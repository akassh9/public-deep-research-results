## Weekly Schedule

### Week 1: **Introduction to Financial Statements**

**Topics & Objectives:** Get introduced to the three main financial statements – **Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement** – and learn how they reflect a company’s financial health ([FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: all the basics in 8 MINS! | Video Summary and Q&A | Glasp](https://glasp.co/youtube/p/financial-statements-all-the-basics-in-8-mins#:~:text=,assets%20equal%20liabilities%20plus%20equity)). By the end of the week, you should be able to describe the purpose of each statement and how they interconnect (e.g. how net income links from the income statement to retained earnings on the balance sheet).  
**Key Takeaways:** Financial statements provide a structured summary of a business’s financial performance and position ([Financial Statements: List of Types and How to Read Them](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp#:~:text=,uses%20its%20cash%20to%20pay)). The balance sheet shows assets, liabilities, and equity at a point in time; the income statement shows revenues, expenses, and profits over a period; the cash flow statement reports cash inflows and outflows (operating, investing, financing) ([FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: all the basics in 8 MINS! | Video Summary and Q&A | Glasp](https://glasp.co/youtube/p/financial-statements-all-the-basics-in-8-mins#:~:text=,operating%2C%20investing%2C%20and%20financing%20activities)). Together, these statements are used by investors and analysts to evaluate a company ([Financial Statements: List of Types and How to Read Them](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp#:~:text=A%20business%27s%20financial%20data%20is,contains%20the%20firm%27s%20financial%20statements)).

### Week 2: **Financial Statement Analysis & Ratios**

**Topics & Objectives:** Learn how to interpret financial statements using **ratio analysis**. This week focuses on evaluating a company’s performance in terms of profitability, efficiency, liquidity, and solvency. Objectives: calculate key financial ratios (e.g. Return on Equity, Profit Margin, Current Ratio, Debt-to-Equity) and understand what they indicate. By week’s end, you should be comfortable analyzing trends in these ratios and comparing them to industry benchmarks ([Financial Ratio Analysis: Definition, Types, Examples, and How to Use](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratioanalysis.asp#:~:text=%2A%20Ratio%20analysis%20compares%20line,current%20ratio%2C%20gross%20profit%20margin)).  
**Key Takeaways:** _Ratio analysis_ involves comparing line items from financial statements to assess a firm’s profitability, liquidity, efficiency, and solvency ([Financial Ratio Analysis: Definition, Types, Examples, and How to Use](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratioanalysis.asp#:~:text=%2A%20Ratio%20analysis%20compares%20line,current%20ratio%2C%20gross%20profit%20margin)). It helps track performance over time and compare different companies ([Financial Ratio Analysis: Definition, Types, Examples, and How to Use](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratioanalysis.asp#:~:text=,ratio%2C%20and%20inventory%20turnover%20ratio)). For example, the **current ratio** (current assets/current liabilities) measures liquidity, **profit margins** gauge profitability, and **debt ratios** assess leverage. No single ratio tells the full story – analysts use a combination to get a comprehensive view ([Financial Ratio Analysis: Definition, Types, Examples, and How to Use](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratioanalysis.asp#:~:text=,current%20ratio%2C%20gross%20profit%20margin)).

- _Optional:_ Chapter on ratio analysis from **“Financial Reporting & Analysis”** textbook or CFA Level I curriculum (for a more rigorous treatment).  
    **Assignment:** _Ratio Analysis Case_ – You are given a simplified balance sheet and income statement for two years for “XYZ Corp” (data provided in an Excel sheet). Calculate the following for both years: gross profit margin, net profit margin, ROE, ROA, current ratio, debt-to-equity. Write a brief analysis (approximately 500 words) commenting on whether the company’s profitability improved, liquidity is sufficient, and leverage is high or low. Highlight one strong aspect and one concern you see from the ratios. _(Use Excel formulas to compute the ratios; try creating a small dashboard in Excel to organize the calculations.)_  
    **Self-Assessment:** Verify your calculated ratios with the provided solution sheet (the assignment data will come with an answer key showing the correct ratios and an example analysis). For additional practice, use an online quiz like **Investopedia’s Fundamental Analysis Quiz** or attempt end-of-chapter problems from a textbook, checking solutions manually. By now, ensure you can confidently answer: “What does a decline in the current ratio signify?” or “Why is ROE higher than ROA for a company with debt?” and similar conceptual questions.

### Week 3: **Time Value of Money (TVM) & Financial Mathematics**

**Topics & Objectives:** Master the concept of the **time value of money** – the idea that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future ([Time Value of Money: What It Is and How It Works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways)). This week’s goal is to learn how to calculate present values, future values, and understand discounting and compounding. You will practice computing **Net Present Value (NPV)** and **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** for simple cash flows. By the end, you should be able to solve problems like “What is the future value of $1,000 in 5 years at 8%?” or “What is the present value of receiving $500 annually for 5 years?” and explain _why_ money has time value (interest opportunities and inflation ([Time Value of Money: What It Is and How It Works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp#:~:text=Power%20of%20Compound%20Interest))).  
**Key Takeaways:** The time value of money (TVM) principle states that money now is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its earning potential ([Time Value of Money: What It Is and How It Works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways)). This is the foundation for valuation: we **discount** future cash flows to present value using a required return. The formula for future value (FV) and present value (PV) incorporates the interest rate (or discount rate) over time ([Time Value of Money: What It Is and How It Works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp#:~:text=Based%20on%20these%20variables%2C%20the,TVM%20formula%20is)). Mastery of TVM means understanding compounding (earning interest on interest) ([Time Value of Money: What It Is and How It Works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp#:~:text=Power%20of%20Compound%20Interest)) and discounting (the reverse). For example, at 10% annual interest, $1 today is worth about $1.61 in 5 years (FV), and conversely $1 five years from now is worth about $0.62 today (PV).  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“Time Value of Money – Compounding and Discounting”_ – (Khan Academy Finance playlist) – Introduces present value, future value, and discount rate with examples.
- _“Net Present Value (NPV) and IRR Explained”_ – by Corporate Finance Institute – Demonstrates how to discount a series of cash flows and what IRR signifies in capital budgeting.

Formula and Calculation - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/presentvalue.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20Present%20Value%3F%20Formula,on%20making%20good%20assumptions)).  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Time Value of Money: What It Is and How It Works”_ – Key takeaways on TVM and the formula for computing it ([Time Value of Money: What It Is and How It Works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways)) ([Time Value of Money: What It Is and How It Works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp#:~:text=Based%20on%20these%20variables%2C%20the,TVM%20formula%20is)).
- Investopedia: _“Present Value (PV) and Future Value (FV)”_ – Definitions and simple examples of PV and FV calculations.
- _Optional:_ Chapter 2 of **“Corporate Finance” (Brealey, Myers)** or CFA Level I Quantitative Methods on TVM for a deeper mathematical treatment (including annuities and perpetuities).  
    **Assignment:** _Time Value Calculations_ – Solve a set of short problems: (a) Calculate the future value of $2,000 invested for 3 years at 5% annual interest (both simple and compounded annually). (b) Calculate the present value of $10,000 to be received in 10 years assuming a 7% discount rate. (c) You win a lottery that pays $5,000 at the end of each of the next 5 years – if the discount rate is 10%, what is the NPV of this prize? (d) If a project costs $100 today and will return $140 in 4 years, what is its IRR? Use Excel to perform these calculations (Excel’s `NPV` and `RATE` functions can help verify your manual work).  
    **Self-Assessment:** Check your answers with the provided solutions: for example, verify that (a) FV ≈ $2,315.25 with compounding, (b) PV ≈ $5,083.49, (c) NPV ≈ $18,954, and (d) IRR ≈ 8.78%. If you made errors, review the formula: _FV = PV_(1+r)^n* and _PV = FV/(1+r)^n_. Try additional questions from Khan Academy’s practice or the CFA Institute’s practice problems on TVM. Ensure you can explain in words questions like “Why does a higher discount rate make a present value lower?” ([Time Value of Money: What It Is and How It Works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp#:~:text=Money%20not%20invested%20can%20lose,will%20have%20reduced%20its%20value)).

### Week 4: **Bond Valuation and Interest Rates**

**Topics & Objectives:** Dive into **fixed income basics**. This week covers how to value a bond, the meaning of yield to maturity (YTM), and the relationship between interest rates and bond prices. Objectives: Calculate the price of a bond given its coupon rate, YTM, and maturity; understand concepts of premium vs. discount bonds; and grasp interest rate risk. By the end, you should be able to answer: “Why do bond prices fall when interest rates rise?” and compute yields or values for simple bonds.  
**Key Takeaways:** A **bond** is a debt instrument that pays periodic interest (coupons) and returns principal at maturity ([Bond Valuation: Calculation, Definition, Formula, and Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-valuation.asp#:~:text=A%20bond%20is%20a%20debt,of%20a%20regular%20bond%20include)). **Bond valuation** involves finding the present value of all future coupon payments plus the face value repayment ([Bond Valuation: Calculation, Definition, Formula, and Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-valuation.asp#:~:text=,bond%20investment%20worth%20the%20cost)). The discount rate used is typically the bond’s yield to maturity (the return an investor expects if holding to maturity) ([Bond Valuation: Calculation, Definition, Formula, and Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-valuation.asp#:~:text=The%20discount%20rate%20used%20is,rate%2C%20and%20time%20to%20maturity)). Important: Bond prices and market interest rates move inversely – if interest rates go up, existing bond values go down ([Bond Valuation: Calculation, Definition, Formula, and Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-valuation.asp#:~:text=not%20necessarily%20the%20invested%20principal,less%20than%20the%20par%20value)) (because their fixed coupons become less attractive) and vice versa. For example, a bond with a fixed 5% coupon will trade at a **discount** if new bonds yield 6% in the market ([Bond Valuation: Calculation, Definition, Formula, and Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-valuation.asp#:~:text=not%20necessarily%20the%20invested%20principal,less%20than%20the%20par%20value)).  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“Bond Pricing 101”_ – (Tutor’s Channel or Khan Academy) – Shows how to calculate bond present value using discounted cash flows for coupons and principal.
- _“Yield to Maturity Explained”_ – a video explaining YTM and how it’s the internal rate of return on bond cash flows.
- _“Why Bond Prices Move Inversely to Yields”_ – an illustrative video (by The Plain Bagel or similar) demonstrating rate-price inverse relationship ([Bond Valuation: Calculation, Definition, Formula, and Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-valuation.asp#:~:text=not%20necessarily%20the%20invested%20principal,less%20than%20the%20par%20value)).  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Bond Valuation”_ – Details the process of determining a bond’s fair value by discounting its fixed payments ([Bond Valuation: Calculation, Definition, Formula, and Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-valuation.asp#:~:text=,bond%20investment%20worth%20the%20cost)) ([Bond Valuation: Calculation, Definition, Formula, and Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-valuation.asp#:~:text=The%20discount%20rate%20used%20is,rate%2C%20and%20time%20to%20maturity)).
- Investopedia: _“Understanding Bond Prices and Yields”_ – Explains how yield to maturity is calculated and why a bond’s current yield differs from its YTM.
- _Optional:_ _Chapter on Fixed Income_ from **Fabozzi’s “Bond Markets”** or CFA Level I Fixed Income for advanced topics like duration (if interested in interest rate risk measurement).  
    **Assignment:** _Bond Valuation Exercise_ – Consider a **5-year bond** with a face value of $1,000, a 4% annual coupon (paid annually). (a) If the market yield (YTM) is 3%, calculate the bond’s price (expect it to be above $1,000 since coupon > yield). (b) If the YTM is 5%, calculate the price (should be below par). (c) Compute the current yield in each case and compare to the YTM. (d) Bonus: Using Excel, create a small table varying YTM from 1% to 10% and graph the bond’s price – observe the inverse relationship.  
    **Self-Assessment:** Use Excel or a financial calculator to verify your answers: for (a) price ≈ $1,041 (premium), (b) price ≈ $959 (discount). Ensure you understand that when YTM < coupon rate, Price > Par (premium), and when YTM > coupon, Price < Par ([Bond Valuation: Calculation, Definition, Formula, and Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond-valuation.asp#:~:text=not%20necessarily%20the%20invested%20principal,less%20than%20the%20par%20value)). Reflect: If interest rates suddenly double, what happens to long-term bond prices versus short-term bonds? You can self-test with conceptual questions on Investopedia’s quiz or by explaining aloud _why a long-term bond is more sensitive to rate changes (hint: more distant cash flows)_.

### Week 5: **Stock Market Basics & Equity Securities**

**Topics & Objectives:** Introduce **stocks (equity)** and how stock markets function. Objectives: Understand what a share of stock represents (ownership in a company), the difference between common and preferred stock, basics of how stocks are traded on exchanges, and why stock prices move. By the end of this week, you should be familiar with stock terminology (market capitalization, dividends, P/E ratio) and be able to explain, in simple terms, what causes stock prices to rise or fall in the short run (news, earnings, investor sentiment) vs. the long run (company earnings and fundamentals).  
**Key Takeaways:** Owning a **stock** means owning a fraction of a company’s assets and earnings. Stocks are traded in markets like the NYSE or NASDAQ, and their prices fluctuate based on supply and demand. In general, stock prices reflect investors’ expectations of a company’s future performance. Key concepts include **market indexes** (e.g. S&P 500 as a market barometer), **dividends** (periodic payments to shareholders), and **equity valuation metrics** like the Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio. Stocks historically offer higher returns than bonds but with higher volatility (risk). Understanding stock market basics is crucial for equity research and hedge fund roles.  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“What is a Stock? How the Stock Market Works”_ – (Kurzgesagt or 365 Financial Analyst on YouTube) – A beginner-friendly explainer of stock ownership and exchanges.
- _“Stocks vs Bonds – Investing Basics”_ – (Khan Academy) – Compares equities and fixed income, useful for understanding risk/return differences.
- _“Stock Market Indices Explained”_ – A short video on why indices like the Dow or S&P matter and how they are constructed.  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Stocks: What They Are and How They Work”_ – Overview of equity, common vs preferred stock rights, etc.
- Investopedia: _“How the Stock Market Works”_ – Basics of stock exchanges, order types, and what causes prices to change (mentions factors like earnings, economic indicators, sentiment).
- _Optional:_ “Stocks” chapter from _“The Little Book of Common Sense Investing” by John Bogle_ for a foundational perspective on equity investing and index funds.  
    **Assignment:** _Market Observation Journal_ – Pick one stock (perhaps a well-known company like Apple or Amazon) and follow its price over the week. Each day, record the closing price and any major news or market movements. At week’s end, write a short summary (300–500 words) linking any news/events to the stock’s price movement. For example, did the stock rise on a day the company announced earnings? How did broader market moves (say, the S&P 500’s trend) affect it? Also, identify the stock’s P/E ratio and dividend yield (you can find these on Yahoo Finance or similar) and note what they suggest about investor expectations.  
    **Self-Assessment:** Compare your observations with professional market commentary. For instance, if Apple’s stock fell 3% when the market was flat, check news sources to see if an analyst downgrade or earnings miss was the cause – did you catch that? Test yourself with questions: _“What’s the difference between a stock’s price and its market cap?”_, _“Why might a high P/E stock be considered ‘expensive’?”_. Use a resource like the **Investopedia Stock Market Quiz** to ensure you grasp the essentials (e.g., understanding that stocks represent ownership and entail voting rights, or why companies issue stock).

### Week 6: **Equity Valuation Techniques (DCF and Multiples)**

**Topics & Objectives:** Learn the fundamental methods of **valuing stocks**. This week focuses on **intrinsic valuation** (Discounted Cash Flow analysis) versus **relative valuation** (using comparables and multiples). Objectives: Understand how to project free cash flows and discount them to estimate a stock’s intrinsic value (DCF), and how to use valuation multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA, etc.) to value a company relative to peers. You will also learn _when_ each method is appropriate. By the end, you should be able to articulate how a DCF works and perform a basic one, as well as compute a valuation using a P/E ratio comparison.  
**Key Takeaways:** **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** valuation involves forecasting a company’s free cash flows and discounting them by the **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)** to get the present value (intrinsic worth) of the business ([Essential Technicals for a Corporate Finance Internship - InFinance.me](https://www.infinance.me/blog/essential-technicals-for-a-corporate-finance-internship#:~:text=,Method)) ([Essential Technicals for a Corporate Finance Internship - InFinance.me](https://www.infinance.me/blog/essential-technicals-for-a-corporate-finance-internship#:~:text=While%20Multiples%20Valuation%20offers%20a,unique%20businesses%20or%20volatile%20markets)). **Multiples valuation** (comparables) involves looking at ratios of similar companies (like price-to-earnings) to infer a valuation – for example, if peers trade at 15× earnings, a company with $2 EPS might be valued around $30. Each approach has its uses: DCF is very detailed and company-specific, providing an intrinsic value, while multiples offer a quick market-relative snapshot ([Essential Technicals for a Corporate Finance Internship - InFinance.me](https://www.infinance.me/blog/essential-technicals-for-a-corporate-finance-internship#:~:text=While%20Multiples%20Valuation%20offers%20a,unique%20businesses%20or%20volatile%20markets)). Often, analysts use both to cross-check. A key skill is knowing which method to emphasize given the situation (stable cash-flow businesses are suited for DCF, while high-growth or hard-to-forecast firms might be often valued via comparables) ([Essential Technicals for a Corporate Finance Internship - InFinance.me](https://www.infinance.me/blog/essential-technicals-for-a-corporate-finance-internship#:~:text=)).

    **Assignment:** _Mini Valuation Project_ – Perform a basic valuation for a company of your choice (or use a provided case). **Part A: DCF.** Using simplified assumptions, project the company’s free cash flow for the next 5 years (you can assume a growth rate or use consensus if available) and assume a terminal growth rate for beyond year 5. Estimate an appropriate discount rate (WACC) – you can use 8-10% if unsure, or calculate using a provided formula and inputs (cost of equity via CAPM, etc.). Compute the DCF value per share. **Part B: Comparables.** Identify 3 comparable companies and note their P/E ratios (or EV/EBITDA). Take an average or median multiple and apply it to your company’s metrics (e.g. your company’s EPS * peer P/E). **Part C:** Write a short summary (1-2 pages) of your valuation findings – compare the DCF-derived value and the multiples-derived value. Are they roughly consistent or is there a big divergence? Discuss possible reasons (e.g. your company has higher growth prospects than peers, which might justify a higher multiple or DCF value).  
    **Self-Assessment:** Use a simplified model answer provided (the course materials include a sample valuation of “XYZ Corp” for reference). Check if your DCF mechanics were correct: did you discount each year’s cash flow and include a terminal value? Did you use WACC properly? Also, ensure understanding of multiples: if your DCF value was $50/share but peer multiples suggest $40, think about what assumptions might differ (maybe your growth or margin forecasts are optimistic). Revisit the lectures if needed, and try explaining your valuation to a friend in simple terms – if you can explain _“I valued the company at 15× earnings, which is a bit above peers because I expect it to grow faster”_ and _“Discounting cash flows at 9% gave me an intrinsic value slightly higher than the current market price, implying it might be undervalued,”_ then you’re on track. Additionally, reflect on a common interview prompt: “**Walk me through a DCF**.” Practice delivering a concise answer covering free cash flow projection, discount rate/WACC, and summing to enterprise value and equity value ([Essential Technicals for a Corporate Finance Internship - InFinance.me](https://www.infinance.me/blog/essential-technicals-for-a-corporate-finance-internship#:~:text=In%20a%20technical%20interview%20for,Being%20equipped%20with%20this)).

### Week 7: **Excel & Financial Modeling (3-Statement Linking)**

**Topics & Objectives:** This week is all about **financial modeling in Excel**, specifically learning to build an integrated three-statement model (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement). Objectives: Learn how the three statements link together (e.g. net income flows into equity via retained earnings, depreciation affects the income statement and is added back in cash flow, etc.), and practice implementing these links in Excel. By the end of the week, you should be able to construct a simple model where, if you change an assumption (like revenue growth or interest expense), the three statements update consistently. This skill is crucial for roles in equity research and financial analysis ([How the 3 Financial Statements are Linked Together - Step by Step](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/3-financial-statements-linked/#:~:text=The%203%20financial%20statements%20,interview%20guides%20to%20learn%20more)) and is a common interview/testing ground ([How the 3 Financial Statements are Linked Together - Step by Step](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/3-financial-statements-linked/#:~:text=together%20in%20Excel%2C%20so%20it%E2%80%99s,interview%20guides%20to%20learn%20more)).  
**Key Takeaways:** The three financial statements are interrelated: **Net Income** from the income statement flows into the cash flow statement (as the starting point for operating cash flow) and into the balance sheet (adding to retained earnings) ([How the 3 Financial Statements are Linked Together - Step by Step](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/3-financial-statements-linked/#:~:text=Net%20Income%20%26%20Retained%20Earnings)). **Changes in balance sheet items** (like working capital) are reflected in the cash flow statement. Building a model means setting up these links so that the balance sheet balances (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) after each forecast period. Mastering this requires understanding accounting principles (accruals vs cash) and Excel skills (formulas, references). Once linked, the model can be used to forecast future periods by making assumptions for revenues, expenses, capital expenditures, etc., and ensuring the cash and debt balances update correctly. This week focuses on constructing the **structure**; next week will extend it to forecasting.  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“How to Link the 3 Financial Statements in Excel”_ – Corporate Finance Institute (CFI) ([Financial Modeling Tutorials by CFI - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl3-0Xe_motRRI5OKbpU2BHLWsiglKCj8#:~:text=Financial%20Modeling%20Tutorials%20by%20CFI,Corporate%20Finance%20Institute)) – A step-by-step live demo of building links between income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement in a simple model (highly recommended to follow along in Excel).
- _“Three Statement Model – Beginner Tutorial”_ – (Breaking Into Wall Street or similar) – Explains the flow of information between statements and common line items to watch (depreciation, working capital changes, etc.).
- _“Common Pitfalls in Financial Modeling”_ – short video or discussion on avoiding circular references, ensuring the balance sheet balances, etc.  
    **Readings:**
- CFI Guide: _“How the 3 Financial Statements are Linked”_ – Breaks down the linkages in text form (net income to retained earnings, etc.) ([How the 3 Financial Statements are Linked Together - Step by Step](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/3-financial-statements-linked/#:~:text=Net%20Income%20%26%20Retained%20Earnings)) and includes an example diagram.
- Wall Street Prep blog: _“Balancing the Balance Sheet – A Modeling Guide”_ – Tips on setting up a model so assets equal liabilities + equity, including setting up a “cash flow sweep” for excess cash or debt (advanced topic, optional).
- _Optional:_ _“Financial Modeling Best Practices”_ (e.g. from Harvard Business Review or an IB training manual) – for general modeling discipline (color-coding inputs, using checks for balance sheet balance).  
    **Assignment:** _3-Statement Model Construction_ – You will be given historical financial data for a company for the last 2-3 years (income statement and balance sheet). Using Excel, build a model that projects the next year’s financials by making simple assumptions (e.g. revenue growth X%, constant gross margin, etc.). **Steps**: (a) Input the historical financials in Excel. (b) Create forecast lines for the next year: project sales, expenses, calculate EBITDA, etc., down to net income. (c) Set up the balance sheet for the forecast year – link net income to retained earnings, forecast key balance sheet items (perhaps assume cash and debt are the “plugs”). (d) Derive the cash flow statement for the forecast year by linking from changes in balance sheet and projected net income (e.g. use the equation Cash Flow from Operations = Net Income + Depreciation – Increase in A/R – … etc.). (e) Check that your balance sheet balances (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) – if not, debug the linkage errors. _Note:_ This assignment might come with a template structure to guide you. Focus on making the model flow correctly, not on perfect prediction.  
    **Self-Assessment:** You’ll be provided with a completed version of the model to compare against. Verify that your formulas produce the same results. Pay special attention to whether you correctly linked **depreciation** (should appear on I/S, added back on CFS, and subtracted from PPE on B/S) and **working capital** changes (changes in current assets/liabilities affect operating cash flow). If the balance sheet didn’t balance, review the linkage steps (common trouble spots: forgetting to link net income to equity, or mis-calculating the cash change). This exercise mirrors technical test scenarios in interviews ([How the 3 Financial Statements are Linked Together - Step by Step](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/3-financial-statements-linked/#:~:text=together%20in%20Excel%2C%20so%20it%E2%80%99s,interview%20guides%20to%20learn%20more)), so ensure you understand it well. As a self-quiz, try to answer: “How does an increase in depreciation by $10 affect the three statements?” (Expected: Net income down $7 (at 30% tax) on I/S, but +$10 depreciation added back in cash flow so cash +$3; on B/S, PPE -$10, cash +$3, retained earnings -$7, balancing out) – being able to walk through that **verbally** is a great sign of understanding ([How the 3 Financial Statements are Linked Together - Step by Step](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/3-financial-statements-linked/#:~:text=Net%20Income%20%26%20Retained%20Earnings)).

### Week 8: **Financial Forecasting & DCF Modeling (Excel Practice)**

**Topics & Objectives:** Extend your three-statement model to a full **multi-year forecast** and perform a **Discounted Cash Flow valuation** using the model. Objectives: Project a company’s financials for 5 years, derive free cash flow from the forecast, and calculate the company’s equity value via DCF. You will also conduct sensitivity analysis on key assumptions (e.g. growth rate, discount rate). By the end of this week, you should have a working 5-year financial model and a DCF valuation for your case company, reinforcing both your Excel modeling skills and your understanding of valuation.  
**Key Takeaways:** Forecasting involves making reasoned assumptions: revenue growth rates, future profit margins, capital expenditure needs, working capital requirements, etc. Once the three statements are projected, **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** is calculated as after-tax operating cash flow minus capital expenditures and changes in working capital. DCF valuation then discounts these FCFs plus a terminal value back to present using the WACC ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Weighted%20average%20cost%20of%20capital,pay%20to%20finance%20its%20business)) ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways)). The result is the enterprise value, from which you subtract debt and add cash to get equity value, then divide by shares to get an intrinsic share price. This process ties together many pieces learned so far: financial statements, TVM, cost of capital, and growth expectations. Sensitivity analysis is crucial – small changes in WACC or terminal growth can materially impact the valuation, so analysts often present a valuation range.  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“Forecasting Financial Statements (Full Example)”_ – A longer tutorial (possibly in two parts) showing the step-by-step creation of multi-year projections in Excel.
- _“Discounted Cash Flow Model – Full Tutorial”_ – (Mergers & Inquisitions or Finance Train) – Builds a DCF using a forecast model, including calculating terminal value (e.g. using Gordon Growth or exit multiple method).
- _“Excel Sensitivity Analysis for DCF”_ – Short demo of using data tables or manual what-if to see how valuation changes with different WACC or growth assumptions.  
    **Readings:**
- Mergers & Inquisitions: _“DCF Model: Full Guide, Excel Templates, and Video Tutorial”_ – A comprehensive walkthrough of building a DCF model with example ([DCF Model: Full Guide, Excel Templates, and Video Tutorial](https://mergersandinquisitions.com/dcf-model/#:~:text=DCF%20Model%2C%20Step%201%3A%20Unlevered,Free%20Cash%20Flow)) (helpful as a reference while doing your own).
- Investopedia: _“Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)”_ – Review this concept since you’ll use WACC as the discount rate in DCF ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Weighted%20average%20cost%20of%20capital,pay%20to%20finance%20its%20business)) ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways)). Ensure you understand that WACC represents the blended required return for the firm’s investors (debt and equity) ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Weighted%20average%20cost%20of%20capital,pay%20to%20finance%20its%20business)).
- Investopedia: _“Terminal Value (TV)”_ – Explains how to calculate terminal value in a DCF (perpetuity growth vs exit multiple).
- _Optional:_ _“Equity Risk Premium and Beta”_ – If you want to delve into how to estimate the cost of equity (part of WACC) via CAPM, this is covered in CFA materials or Damodaran’s writings.  
    **Assignment:** _Capstone Financial Model & DCF_ – Building on last week’s model, now forecast additional years. **Part A: Multi-year Forecast.** Take the single-year model from Week 7 and extend it to 5 years (e.g. forecast Year1 to Year5). Use reasonable assumptions: for instance, revenue grows at 5% annually, operating margin gradually improves by 1% point by Year5, etc. Keep interest expense and dividends simple or assume no change if unsure. **Part B: Compute Free Cash Flow.** From your forecast, calculate FCF for each of the 5 forecast years: FCF = EBIT * (1–Tax) + Depreciation – CapEx – Increase in NWC. **Part C: DCF Valuation.** Assume a WACC (either given, say 9%, or calculated if you have the data) and a terminal growth rate (e.g. 2.5% or use an EV/EBITDA exit multiple approach). Calculate the present value of all forecasted FCFs and the terminal value to arrive at enterprise value. Deduct net debt to get equity value, then divide by shares to get an intrinsic share price. **Part D: Sensitivity.** Perform a sensitivity analysis by varying WACC (e.g. ±1%) and terminal growth (±1%) – create a small table of outcomes or at least compute a couple of scenarios to see the range of values. Summarize the base-case valuation and the sensitivity range in a brief memo or slide.  
    **Self-Assessment:** Check the reasonableness of your output. Does your DCF valuation make sense relative to the company’s current stock price? (It’s okay if it’s different; just think about why – maybe your assumptions differ from market consensus). Ensure mechanical accuracy: the discount factors were applied correctly, and you didn’t accidentally double-count or omit the terminal value. Use the provided solution file to cross-verify your formulas and results. In the solution, key checks will be: does the balance sheet still balance each year? Does the sum of discounted cash flows equal the shown enterprise value? The solution will also show a sensitivity matrix (commonly a table of output values for different WACC and growth assumptions) – compare yours. Finally, take a step back and articulate the story: _“My base DCF gave $50 per share, versus the current $45 – suggesting a bit undervalued if our growth (5%) and WACC (9%) assumptions hold. If WACC were 10% or growth 1% lower, the value drops closer to the current price, which shows how sensitive the model is.”_ Being able to interpret the numbers is just as important as calculating them. This comprehensive exercise solidifies many concepts, so feel proud – you’ve essentially done a mini-valuation project similar to what analysts do!

### Week 9: **Risk, Return, and Portfolio Basics**

**Topics & Objectives:** Shift focus to **investment theory**: risk vs return trade-off, diversification, and basic portfolio concepts. Objectives: Understand how to quantify risk (variance, standard deviation of returns), what the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** is (and how it estimates required return based on beta risk ([CAPM Model: Advantages and Disadvantages](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021015/advantages-and-disadvantages-capm-model.asp#:~:text=The%20capital%20asset%20pricing%20model,free%20rate))), and why diversification helps reduce unsystematic risk. By week’s end, you should be able to explain in plain language why stocks have higher expected returns than bonds (risk premium), calculate an expected portfolio return given weights and asset returns, and understand the concept of beta and the Security Market Line.  
**Key Takeaways:** **Risk and return** are positively related – investors demand a higher expected return for taking on more risk ([CAPM Model: Advantages and Disadvantages](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021015/advantages-and-disadvantages-capm-model.asp#:~:text=The%20capital%20asset%20pricing%20model,free%20rate)). CAPM formalizes this: Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + _Beta_ × (Market Return – Risk-Free) ([CAPM Model: Advantages and Disadvantages](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021015/advantages-and-disadvantages-capm-model.asp#:~:text=The%20capital%20asset%20pricing%20model,free%20rate)). Beta is a measure of a stock’s volatility relative to the market – a beta of 1 means the stock tends to move with the market, >1 means more volatile than market, <1 less volatile. Diversification can eliminate **unsystematic risk** (company-specific risk), leaving only **systematic risk** (market risk) which is what beta captures. An efficiently diversified portfolio (as in Modern Portfolio Theory) can achieve a given expected return with lower volatility than any single asset could (hence the benefit of not “putting all eggs in one basket”). This sets the stage for understanding portfolio management in later weeks.  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“CAPM and Beta Explained”_ – (Bloomberg or academic lecture) – Explains the intuition behind CAPM ([CAPM Model: Advantages and Disadvantages](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021015/advantages-and-disadvantages-capm-model.asp#:~:text=The%20capital%20asset%20pricing%20model,free%20rate)) and how to use the formula to estimate cost of equity or expected return.
- _“Efficient Frontier and Diversification”_ – A basic explanation of Markowitz’s efficient frontier concept (optional, if time permits) to illustrate the risk/return optimization idea.  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)”_ – Describes the model, assumptions, and its formula ([CAPM Model: Advantages and Disadvantages](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021015/advantages-and-disadvantages-capm-model.asp#:~:text=The%20capital%20asset%20pricing%20model,free%20rate)), including an example of calculating an expected return using beta.

- Investopedia: _“Diversification: Why and How”_ – Highlights how spreading investments across asset classes or securities lowers overall portfolio volatility ([Concentrated vs. Diversified Portfolios - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/concentrated-vs-diversified-portfolios-comparing-pros-and-cons.asp#:~:text=Concentrated%20vs.%20Diversified%20Portfolios%20,other%20investments%20in%20the)) ([5 Tips for Diversifying Your Portfolio - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/072303.asp#:~:text=5%20Tips%20for%20Diversifying%20Your,Diversified%3F%20By)).
- _Optional:_ _“Stocks, Bonds, and Risk”_ chapter from **“Essentials of Investments” (Bodie, Kane, Marcus)** – provides more detail on historical risk/return of different asset classes and intro to portfolio math.  
    **Assignment:** _Portfolio Risk & Return Calculation_ – Imagine a simple portfolio: 50% in Stock A and 50% in Stock B. Stock A had returns of 10%, -5%, 15% in the last 3 years; Stock B had returns of 6%, 4%, 8% in the same years (these are sample annual returns). (a) Calculate the 3-year average annual return and standard deviation of returns for Stock A and Stock B individually. (b) Calculate the portfolio’s annual returns for those years (the average of A and B each year, since equal weight) and then compute the portfolio’s average return and standard deviation. Confirm that the portfolio volatility is lower than the weighted average of the individual volatilities, demonstrating diversification benefit. (c) If Stock A’s beta is 1.2 and Stock B’s beta is 0.8, what is the portfolio beta? Given a risk-free rate of 2% and expected market return of 8%, use CAPM to estimate the required return of each stock and of the portfolio. (d) Reflect: did the actual average returns you calculated align with the required returns from CAPM? (This is more of an insight question—realize that in short 3-year samples, they may not align closely, which is fine.) Use Excel for calculations to practice handling return data.  
    **Self-Assessment:** Check your calculations with an answer key: likely results – Stock A average ~6.67% with higher std dev, Stock B average ~6% with lower std dev, portfolio average ~6.33% with std dev lower than both (diversification benefit since A and B’s returns aren’t perfectly correlated). Ensure conceptually you see that combining a volatile stock with a stable stock yields smoother returns ([Concentrated vs. Diversified Portfolios - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/concentrated-vs-diversified-portfolios-comparing-pros-and-cons.asp#:~:text=Diversification%20reduces%20an%20investor%27s%20overall,other%20investments%20in%20the)). For CAPM, if R_f=2%, Market=8%, then required return for A = 2% +1.2*(6%)=9.2%, for B = 2% +0.8*6%=6.8%, portfolio beta = 1.0 so req. return = 8%. Realize if our historical averages differ, it could be due to noise or the stocks outperforming/underperforming in that period. To self-test, explain: “How does diversification reduce risk?” (Expected: By holding multiple assets, the idiosyncratic ups and downs cancel out, leaving only overall market risk). Also, try a conceptual question: “If a stock has a beta of 0.5, what does that imply about its volatility and required return relative to the market?” (Answer: It’s less volatile, so required return would be lower than the market’s, as per CAPM). These are common interview-level questions and understanding them now will help in Week 23’s interview prep.

### Week 10: **Cost of Capital & Corporate Finance Decisions**

**Topics & Objectives:** This week bridges into **corporate finance**: focusing on the **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**, capital structure (debt vs equity financing), and capital budgeting decisions (NPV, IRR, payback). Objectives: Learn to calculate WACC ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Weighted%20average%20cost%20of%20capital,pay%20to%20finance%20its%20business)), understand how companies decide on using debt or equity (and the trade-offs), and apply NPV/IRR to evaluate project investments. By the end, you should be comfortable computing WACC given component costs, determining whether a project creates value (NPV > 0), and discussing why a firm might prefer one financing source over another.  
**Key Takeaways:** **WACC** is the average rate a company is expected to pay its security holders to finance its assets ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Weighted%20average%20cost%20of%20capital,pay%20to%20finance%20its%20business)). It blends the cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt in proportion to their usage in the capital structure ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Weighted%20average%20cost%20of%20capital,pay%20to%20finance%20its%20business)) ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways)). A firm’s WACC is often used as the hurdle rate for investment decisions ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=,in%20discounted%20cash%20flow%20analysis)) – only projects with expected returns above WACC should be undertaken (positive NPV). **Capital structure** theory (Modigliani-Miller, etc.) suggests under ideal conditions it doesn’t matter, but in practice companies balance the tax benefits of debt (interest is tax-deductible) with the financial risk of too much debt. Tools: **NPV** (present value of inflows minus outflows) is the gold standard for evaluating projects – if NPV > 0, accept. **IRR** is the discount rate that sets NPV=0, and projects with IRR > WACC are good (generally). Understanding these helps in consulting and finance roles where you advise on investments or funding strategies.  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“WACC Explained”_ – A tutorial (maybe by Prof. Aswath Damodaran or corporate trainer) on calculating WACC, including the formula and an example.
- _“Capital Structure – Debt vs Equity”_ – An overview video discussing why companies might issue debt (cheaper cost, tax shield) vs equity (no mandatory payments, but dilutes ownership) and how an optimal structure might minimize WACC.
- _“NPV and IRR Capital Budgeting”_ – Khan Academy or similar video working through a project cash flow example to compute NPV and IRR, reinforcing Week 3’s TVM in a corporate decision context.  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)”_ – Definition and example ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Weighted%20average%20cost%20of%20capital,pay%20to%20finance%20its%20business)) ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways)), make sure to note that WACC is often used as a **hurdle rate** ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=,in%20discounted%20cash%20flow%20analysis)).
- Investopedia: _“Cost of Capital: Why It Matters”_ – Broad discussion on what cost of capital means for a business and how it’s used in decision making.
- Investopedia: _“NPV vs IRR: What’s the Difference?”_ – Clarifies strengths/weaknesses of each method (e.g. IRR can be misleading in non-normal cash flows, NPV is better for absolute value creation).
- _Optional:_ _“The Weighted Average Cost of Capital”_ chapter in a Corporate Finance textbook for a detailed look at estimating each component (like using CAPM for cost of equity ([CAPM Model: Advantages and Disadvantages](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021015/advantages-and-disadvantages-capm-model.asp#:~:text=The%20capital%20asset%20pricing%20model,free%20rate)), etc.).  
    **Assignment:** _Capital Budgeting Case_ – You’re given a scenario: _TechCo_ is considering a new project launching a product. Initial investment is $5 million, and it will generate cash flows of $1.5 million per year for 5 years. The company’s WACC is 8%. (a) Calculate the project’s NPV. (b) Calculate its IRR. (c) Should TechCo proceed with the project and why? (d) Now assume TechCo can finance this project either by borrowing at 5% or issuing equity expecting ~10% cost – discuss qualitatively how using debt vs equity might affect the WACC and the decision (this part is conceptual – e.g., if they use debt, WACC might be lower due to cheap debt but too much debt could raise equity’s cost due to risk). Additionally, compute TechCo’s WACC given the following capital structure: $20M equity at 10% cost, $10M debt at 5% cost, 30% tax rate (to incorporate the tax shield on debt). (Use the WACC formula to get a number.)  
    **Self-Assessment:** For the project, you should find NPV = -$5M + sum of PV of $1.5M for 5 years (discount 8%) ≈ $0.2M (a small positive NPV), and IRR solving $0 NPV ~ slightly above 8% (probably ~9-10%). So project is acceptable (NPV > 0). Check that you knew to discount at WACC because that’s the required return/hurdle. For WACC calculation, with given weights (2/3 equity, 1/3 debt) and costs, WACC = 2/3_10% + 1/3_5%*(1-0.30) ≈ 7.33%. This exercise confirms understanding that **debt is adjusted for taxes** in WACC ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Weighted%20average%20cost%20of%20capital,pay%20to%20finance%20its%20business)). Review: if your WACC calc or NPV was off, revisit formulas. Finally, ensure you can explain: “What does WACC represent and how is it used in valuation?” (It’s the discount rate for DCF, reflecting the required return of all capital providers ([Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp#:~:text=Weighted%20average%20cost%20of%20capital,pay%20to%20finance%20its%20business))), and “Why might a company have a lower WACC at moderate debt levels?” (Because debt is cheaper than equity, up to a point, due to tax shield – until excessive debt raises overall risk). These concepts often appear in interviews in questions like “How do you calculate WACC?” or “What’s better, NPV or IRR for decision-making?” – being prepared to answer clearly will help in Week 23.

### Week 11: **Macroeconomics and Market Analysis**

**Topics & Objectives:** Broaden your view to the **macroeconomic environment**. This week’s goal is to understand key macro indicators (GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, unemployment) and how they influence financial markets and investment decisions. Objectives: Learn where to find and how to interpret major economic releases (e.g. GDP report, CPI inflation data, central bank rate decisions) and relate them to market movements (bond yields, stock trends, currency values). By the end, you should be able to discuss how, for example, a rise in interest rates could affect stock valuations (via higher discount rates and impact on corporate earnings) and why hedge funds care about macro trends.  
**Key Takeaways:** **Macroeconomic factors** like economic growth, inflation, and monetary policy have significant effects on investments. For instance, rising inflation often leads to higher interest rates, which can decrease stock valuations (higher discount rate reduces present values) and typically hurts bond prices. GDP growth signals the strength of the economy – strong growth can boost corporate earnings (good for stocks) but also lead to rate hikes if overheating. Investors monitor indicators such as employment numbers, consumer confidence, and central bank announcements. Understanding the **business cycle** helps in asset allocation (e.g. in recessions, defensive stocks or bonds might outperform). As an example, when the Federal Reserve signals rate increases, the market often reacts with a sell-off in rate-sensitive sectors and a strengthening of the currency. In hedge funds and equity research, incorporating a macro view can differentiate a great investment thesis (e.g. being aware that an economic downturn could hit a cyclical company’s performance).

- _“How the Fed (Central Bank) Affects Markets”_ – Explains the mechanism of monetary policy (e.g. raising the federal funds rate) and the ripple effect on bonds, stocks, and consumer behavior.
- _“Top-Down Investment Analysis”_ – Introduction to using macro analysis first (country/sector) then picking stocks, as practiced by some hedge funds (contrasting with bottom-up).  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Macroeconomic Factor”_ – Definition and examples of macro factors (like inflation, unemployment) and note that these are closely watched indicators ([Macroeconomic Factor: Definition, Types, Examples, and Impact](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomic-factor.asp#:~:text=A%20macroeconomic%20factor%20is%20an,governments%2C%20businesses%2C%20and%20consumers%20alike)) ([Macroeconomic Factor: Definition, Types, Examples, and Impact](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macroeconomic-factor.asp#:~:text=,be%20positive%2C%20negative%2C%20or%20neutral)).
- Investopedia: _“Economic Indicators You Should Know”_ – Lists important indicators and why they matter ([Economic Indicators That Help Predict Market Trends](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/leading-economic-indicators.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways)) ([Economic Indicators That Help Predict Market Trends](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/leading-economic-indicators.asp#:~:text=Market%20Indexes)) (for instance, housing starts as a leading indicator).
- Investopedia: _“Monetary Policy and the Fed”_ – Overview of how central bank policy can slow or spur the economy and markets.
- _Optional:_ **IMF or World Bank Blog** on current macro trends (for example, a summary of the global economic outlook) to apply what you learn to real current events.  
    **Assignment:** _Macro Research Brief_ – Select one recent macroeconomic report or event (examples: the latest quarterly GDP growth figure of your country, the latest inflation (CPI) reading, or a central bank interest rate decision). Write a one-page brief summarizing: (a) What the indicator/result was (e.g. “Q2 GDP grew at 2.5% annualized, above expectations”). (b) What this suggests about the economy (expanding, slowing, inflationary pressures?). (c) How financial markets reacted or would be expected to react – e.g., did bond yields rise? Did the stock market move on the news? Connect logically: _“Higher GDP growth and rising inflation might push the central bank to hike rates, which usually leads to higher bond yields and can pressure equity valuations.”_ (d) Conclude with your view on what it means for an investor (for example, “Given this macro backdrop, one might favor stocks in industries that benefit from rising rates, like banks, and be cautious on rate-sensitive sectors like utilities.”). This exercise develops your ability to tie macro data to investment implications.  
    **Self-Assessment:** Compare your brief to professional commentary (for instance, read a Bloomberg or Reuters article on that event after writing your own). Did you catch the main points? Over time, you’ll get better at this. Key checks: ensure you mention whether the indicator was **better or worse than expected**, as that often drives market reaction. Also, double-check cause and effect – e.g. don’t say “inflation fell, so yields rose” without reasoning (actually if inflation fell more than expected, yields often fall because rate hike expectations ease). To test understanding, consider questions like: _“If the Federal Reserve signals faster rate hikes, what might that do to stock P/E multiples and why?”_ (Answer: likely compress them, since higher rates mean higher discount rates and bonds become more attractive alternatives ([Macroeconomic Indicators That Affect the US Stock Market](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031413/economic-indicatiors-affect-us-stock-market.asp#:~:text=URL%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Farticles%2Finvesting%2F031413%2Feconomic))). Or _“Why do growth stocks tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than value stocks?”_ (Because more of their earnings are far in the future, so higher discount rates reduce their present value more). Being able to articulate these connections shows you can integrate macro with finance – a valuable skill for interviews and real-world analysis.

### Week 12: **Derivatives and Risk Management**

**Topics & Objectives:** Introduce **derivatives** (options, futures, swaps) and basic risk management techniques. Objectives: Understand what derivatives are and how they derive value from underlying assets ([Understanding Derivatives: A Comprehensive Guide to Their Uses ...](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp#:~:text=,by%20fluctuations%20in%20that%20asset)), learn the difference between a call and put option, grasp the concept of using futures or forwards to hedge, and see examples of how investors or companies use derivatives to manage risk (e.g. an airline hedging fuel prices with futures). By the end, you should be comfortable with fundamental options terminology (strike, expiration, call/put payoff) and be able to explain a simple hedging example in your own words. This will give you exposure to a key area of finance (often part of MSF curriculum and used by hedge funds for sophisticated strategies).  
**Key Takeaways:** A **derivative** is a financial contract whose value depends on an underlying asset’s price ([Derivatives vs. Options: What's the Difference? - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070615/what-difference-between-derivatives-and-options.asp#:~:text=Derivatives%20vs,is%20a%20type%20of%20derivative)). Common derivatives: **options** (calls give the right to buy, puts the right to sell an asset at a set price ([10 Options Strategies Every Investor Should Know - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/options-strategies/#:~:text=10%20Options%20Strategies%20Every%20Investor,If%20you))), **futures/forwards** (obligation to buy/sell at a future date at a price set today), **swaps** (exchange of cash flow streams). Derivatives can be used for **hedging** (reducing risk, e.g. locking in a price or insuring against a price move) or **speculation** (seeking profit from price changes with leverage). Key concepts for options: call option value rises if the underlying stock rises (since it gives the right to buy at a fixed price), while a put option gains value if the stock falls ([10 Options Strategies Every Investor Should Know - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/options-strategies/#:~:text=10%20Options%20Strategies%20Every%20Investor,If%20you)). Risk management often involves derivatives: e.g., portfolio managers might buy put options as protection (insurance) against a market drop. While a full quantitative understanding is beyond one week, qualitative understanding of how these tools work and why they’re used is the goal.  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“Derivatives Explained in One Lesson”_ – A beginner-friendly overview of what derivatives are, covering options and futures with simple examples (e.g., a farmer hedging crop prices).
- _“Options Basics: Calls and Puts”_ – (Option Alpha or similar channel) – Visual explanation of how call and put options work, payoff diagrams, and terminology (in-the-money, out-of-the-money).
- _“Real-World Hedging Examples”_ – A short video or news clip showing how a company hedges a risk (for instance, an exporter using currency forwards to lock in exchange rates, or Southwest Airlines famously hedging fuel).  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Derivatives 101: A Beginner’s Guide”_ – Introduces derivatives and common types (futures, options) in layman’s terms ([Derivatives 101: A Beginner's Guide - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/10/derivatives-101.asp#:~:text=Derivatives%20101%3A%20A%20Beginner%27s%20Guide,a%20commodity%2C%20an%20index%2C)) ([Derivatives vs. Options: What's the Difference? - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/070615/what-difference-between-derivatives-and-options.asp#:~:text=Derivatives%20vs,is%20a%20type%20of%20derivative)).
- Investopedia: _“Call and Put Options”_ – Definitions and simple examples of how they function ([10 Options Strategies Every Investor Should Know - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/options-strategies/#:~:text=10%20Options%20Strategies%20Every%20Investor,If%20you)). Also, _“Understanding Option Pricing”_ (to get a feel for factors like volatility affecting option value, though optional).
- Investopedia: _“Hedging Basics: What is a Hedge?”_ – Explains the concept of hedging and some common strategies (using derivatives to offset risk).
- _Optional:_ Chapter from **CFA Level I Derivatives** section (for a structured summary of options, futures, swaps) if you have access, to reinforce terminology and uses.  
    **Assignment:** _Hedging Case Study_ – Assume you are a financial analyst for a firm that expects to receive €1,000,000 in six months from European sales. You worry the euro might weaken (vs. your home currency, USD) by the time you convert the money. (a) Propose a hedging strategy using a forward or futures contract on EUR/USD – describe how it would work (e.g., lock in the exchange rate now for delivery in six months). (b) Alternatively, describe how you could use a currency option (a put option on the euro or a call option on USD) to hedge this risk, and what the advantage of using an option might be (hint: it provides insurance with upside if the euro strengthens). (c) Another scenario: your firm is exposed to oil prices (you buy a lot of fuel). Explain how buying oil futures could hedge your cost. This assignment is more qualitative – focus on articulating the hedging logic in a short write-up (1 page), possibly including a simple payoff scenario table. Optionally, do a simple numerical example: “If current EUR/USD = 1.10 and we lock via forward, we guarantee $1,100,000. If we don’t hedge and EUR/USD drops to 1.00, we’d only get $1,000,000 – thus the hedge would have saved us $100k.”  
    **Self-Assessment:** Reflect on whether your explanations make sense. You can check resources: for example, Investopedia or textbooks often have examples of currency hedges and their outcomes; compare with your description. Ensure clarity on _why_ the hedge is done (to reduce uncertainty of future cash flows). You should be able to answer basic conceptual questions now: _“What is the difference between hedging with forwards vs. options?”_ (Forwards lock in a price but you miss out on favorable moves; options cost a premium but give protection with ability to benefit if the market moves in your favor). _“Why might an investor use options instead of just buying or shorting the stock?”_ (Leverage, limited risk in case of options, or to implement strategies like income generation via selling covered calls). For a quick quiz, define a call and a put option in one sentence each – e.g., _“A call option gives the holder the right, but not obligation, to **buy** an asset at a specified price before expiration, whereas a put gives the right to **sell** an asset at a specified price.”_ ([10 Options Strategies Every Investor Should Know - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/options-strategies/#:~:text=10%20Options%20Strategies%20Every%20Investor,If%20you)). Understanding these definitions and hedging examples is the level you want to reach, which will also help with technical interview questions on derivatives basics.

### Week 13: **Hedge Funds and Investment Strategies**

**Topics & Objectives:** Explore the world of **hedge funds** – what they are, how they differ from mutual funds, and some common hedge fund strategies. Objectives: Understand the characteristics of hedge funds (lightly regulated, use of leverage and short selling, fee structures), and learn about at least 3-4 strategies such as **long/short equity**, **market neutral**, **global macro**, **event-driven** (merger arbitrage, distressed securities), etc. ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=,can%20also%20involve%20distressed%20companies)). By the end, you should be able to describe what a hedge fund does in general and give a simple example of a strategy (e.g. a long/short equity trade: long undervalued Company A, short overvalued Company B in the same industry ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=Long%2FShort%20Equity))). This will connect many concepts you’ve learned to real-world application and prepare you for hedge fund internship interviews or work.  
**Key Takeaways:** **Hedge funds** are private investment funds available to accredited investors, free to use diverse and often aggressive strategies to seek **active returns** (alpha) ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=,can%20also%20involve%20distressed%20companies)). They can go long or short, use derivatives, and leverage. Common strategies include: _Long/Short Equity_ (as described – picking stocks to buy and short, aiming to profit from both winners and losers ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=Long%2FShort%20Equity))), _Market Neutral_ (maintaining balanced exposures to remove market direction risk), _Global Macro_ (trading based on macroeconomic views across asset classes – rates, currencies, commodities), _Event-Driven_ (like merger arbitrage – betting on outcomes of M&A deals, or investing in distressed debt expecting restructuring). Hedge funds aim for absolute returns and often charge high fees (2% management, 20% performance fee). Understanding these strategies gives insight into how sophisticated investors operate and will help in interviews (where you might be asked what strategies interest you).  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“What is a Hedge Fund?”_ – (Wall Street Oasis or financial news segment) – Explains how hedge funds operate, their typical fee structure, and investor base ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20are%20alternative%20investments,accessible%20only%20to%20accredited%20investors)) ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=As%20such%2C%20they%20use%20different,strategies%20that%20are%20outlined%20below)).
- _“Hedge Fund Strategies Overview”_ – Perhaps a CFA Institute video or an educational explainer listing major categories of hedge fund strategies, with examples of each ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=,can%20also%20involve%20distressed%20companies)).
- _“Long/Short Equity Strategy Example”_ – A focused video that walks through a simple pair trade (long one stock, short another) and how it aims to profit regardless of overall market moves ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=Long%2Fshort%20equity%20%20is%20basically,picking%20skill)).  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Hedge Fund: Definition and Strategies”_ – Defines hedge funds and summarizes common strategies ([What Is a Hedge Fund? - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102113/what-are-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20a%20Hedge%20Fund%3F,risky%20strategies%20to%20maximize%20profits)) ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=,can%20also%20involve%20distressed%20companies)).
- Investopedia: _“Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds”_ – Dives into various strategies (long/short, market neutral, arbitrage, etc.) ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=,can%20also%20involve%20distressed%20companies)) ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=Long%2FShort%20Equity)).
- BarclayHedge (industry resource): _“Hedge Fund Strategy Glossary”_ – (optional) gives succinct descriptions of many strategy types.
- _Optional:_ Look up an actual hedge fund’s quarterly letter (sometimes available online) to see how they describe their strategy and positions (e.g. letters from Greenlight Capital or Pershing Square in the past).  
    **Assignment:** _Strategy Case – Long/Short Pitch_ – Imagine you are running a hedge fund with a **long/short equity** strategy. Identify one stock you would go **long** and one stock you would **short** in the current market. Write a one-page pitch that includes: (a) A brief description of each company and why you believe one is undervalued (good long) and the other is overvalued (good short). Use at least one valuation metric or catalyst for each (e.g. “Company X is trading at 8× EBITDA, well below peers ~12×, and has a new product launch that could drive earnings – making it a compelling long. Company Y, however, is at 25× earnings, above peers, with signs of slowing growth – a potential short”). (b) Explain how this pair forms a hedge – ideally they’re in similar sectors, so that if the whole sector drops, your short helps offset losses on the long (and vice versa) ([The Multiple Strategies of Hedge Funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111313/multiple-strategies-hedge-funds.asp#:~:text=Long%2Fshort%20equity%20%20is%20basically,picking%20skill)). (c) Assess the risks: what could go wrong (e.g. “Risk: Company Y could get acquired (short goes up) or Company X’s product launch might fail”). This exercise mimics the kind of thinking hedge funds do and also doubles as stock pitch practice for interviews.  
    **Self-Assessment:** Review your pitch critically or have a mentor/friend review it. Does it clearly state _why_ each stock is long or short material? Check if you incorporated concepts learned: valuation (Week 6), macro or industry context (Week 11 insights possibly), etc. There’s no absolute right or wrong, but you should ensure your reasoning is sound and not purely speculative. To gauge comprehension of hedge fund basics, see if you can answer: _“How is a hedge fund different from a mutual fund in strategy and structure?”_ (Hedge funds have more flexibility – can short, use leverage, not required to stay fully invested, focus on absolute return; also they’re private and have higher fees). Or _“What does a market-neutral strategy aim to achieve?”_ (Eliminate broad market risk to profit purely from stock picking or arbitrage). Also, recall Goal 4 of our course was to apply concepts to hedge fund scenarios – this week’s assignment is a direct reflection of that, so if you found you could combine multiple finance concepts into a strategy, you’re achieving that goal. In interviews, you might be asked to pitch a stock (long or short); having done this, you have a template to use. Plus, you can mention familiarity with strategies like merger arb or macro trading – showing you have a broader awareness beyond textbooks.

### Week 14: **Private Equity and Venture Capital (Alternative Investments)**

**Topics & Objectives:** Examine **alternative investments** focusing on **Private Equity (PE)** and **Venture Capital (VC)** – these are cousins to hedge funds in the alternative space but with different approaches. Objectives: Understand what private equity firms do (buying companies or stakes, often via **Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)**, then improving and eventually exiting), versus venture capital (investing in early-stage startups). Learn key terms like _leveraged buyout, internal rate of return (IRR) targets in PE, fundraising from limited partners (LPs), and difference between growth equity vs buyout._ By the end, you should be able to explain how a PE firm creates value (improving operations, multiple expansion, leverage) and how venture capitalists evaluate startups (market size, team, potential for high growth). This knowledge is useful both for MSF breadth and if considering internships in these areas or consulting projects involving M&A.  
**Key Takeaways:** **Private Equity (PE)** refers to investing in companies that are not publicly traded ([Learn the Lingo of Private Equity Investing - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/abcs-of-private-equity.asp#:~:text=Learn%20the%20Lingo%20of%20Private,public%20and%20private%20companies)) (or taking public companies private). PE firms raise funds from investors (LPs) and use that capital (plus debt) to acquire companies, typically aiming to improve them and sell at a profit in 5-7 years. _Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)_ are a common PE transaction, using debt to amplify returns (though debt also adds risk). Private equity usually deals with mature companies (often established businesses needing turnaround or expansion) ([Private Equity Explained With Examples and Ways to Invest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp#:~:text=Private%20Equity%20Explained%20With%20Examples,their%20portfolio%20companies%20to)), whereas **Venture Capital (VC)** is a form of private equity focusing on early-stage companies (startups) with high growth potential ([What Is Venture Capital? Definition, Pros, Cons, and How It Works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp#:~:text=Venture%20capital%20,businesses%20with%20%2082%20potential)). VCs take equity stakes in startups in exchange for funding, and provide mentorship, with the aim of those startups either going public or being acquired (generating large returns on the few winners to outweigh losses on others). Both PE and VC are illiquid investments – investors commit money for long periods. Key metrics: PE looks at _IRR_ and _Multiple on Invested Capital (MOIC)_ for deals; VC often expects many failures but a few companies returning 10x+. These sectors value financial modeling (esp. LBO models in PE) and strategic analysis – aligning with what you’ve learned.  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“Private Equity Explained”_ – (e.g., Bain & Co or Harvard Business School video) – Describes the PE fund model, the LBO process, and how PE funds create value (operational improvements, governance, leverage, etc.).
- _“What is Venture Capital?”_ – (Kauffman Foundation or TechVC channel) – Outlines how VC funds invest in startups, stages of financing (Seed, Series A, B, etc.), and what VCs look for (team, product-market fit).
- _“LBO in 5 Minutes”_ – A quick conceptual walkthrough of a leveraged buyout example, showing how debt financing can increase equity returns (if available, as a primer before advanced LBO modeling).  
    **Readings:**

- Investopedia: _“Private Equity vs. Venture Capital”_ – Highlights differences in stage (mature vs startup), use of debt (PE uses debt, VC typically does not), investment size, etc. ([Private Equity vs. Venture Capital: What's the Difference?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020415/what-difference-between-private-equity-and-venture-capital.asp#:~:text=Difference%3F%20www,)) ([Private Equity Explained With Examples and Ways to Invest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp#:~:text=In%20contrast%20with%20venture%20capital%2C,their%20portfolio%20companies%20to)).
- Investopedia: _“Venture Capital”_ – Definition and how it works ([What Is Venture Capital?

Definition, Pros, Cons, and How It Works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp#:~:text=,or%20even%20larger%20venture%20funds)), including the high-risk, high-return nature and typical equity stake structure.
- _Optional:_ If interested in deeper dive: Read about a famous PE deal (e.g., the Hilton Hotels LBO by Blackstone) or a VC success story (e.g., early investment in Facebook or Uber) to see these concepts in action.  
    **Assignment:** _LBO Analysis (Conceptual)_ – You are given a simplified scenario: A PE firm is considering buying a company for $100 million. They will finance it with $30 million equity from the fund and $70 million debt (a typical highly leveraged structure). In 5 years, they plan to sell the company. Assume the company’s value grows to $160 million in that time and some debt is paid down to $50 million. (a) What is the equity value at exit for the PE firm? (Company value $160M – $50M debt = $110M equity). (b) What multiple of their original equity investment is that? (~3.67x on $30M initial to $110M final). (c) Calculate a rough IRR for that 5-year investment (you can approximate or use the IRR formula – it should be around 30%+ IRR). (d) Discuss qualitatively what factors could have driven this value creation (e.g., EBITDA growth, multiple expansion, debt paydown – in this case, initial $100M to $160M is value increase, plus debt paydown enhanced equity). Now for venture capital: Imagine a VC invested $5M in a startup at a $20M post-money valuation for 25% ownership. 5 years later, the startup goes public at a value of $200M. (e) What is the VC’s stake worth at exit? (25% of $200M = $50M). (f) What multiple is that on the $5M? (10x) – which is common in VC hits. Write a short commentary comparing the PE outcome vs the VC outcome, noting the risk (the PE deal likely had more certainty with a mature company and debt, the VC deal had potential to either go big or fail, etc.).  
    **Self-Assessment:** Check calculations: the LBO case equity IRR ~30% (a great return), the VC case a 10x which is huge (but note that many VC investments go to zero, whereas PE usually doesn’t expect complete failure of a portfolio company). Make sure you conceptually understand: _“Why does using debt (leverage) increase equity returns in a successful PE deal?”_ (Because the firm invests less equity; at exit, after paying off debt, the remaining equity captures the value growth – leverage amplifies gains, but would also amplify losses or risk of bankruptcy). _“Why don’t VCs use debt in startups?”_ (Startups have uncertain cash flows and assets, cannot support debt – they need flexible equity funding). _“How do PE and VC measure performance?”_ (Both use IRR; PE often also looks at MOIC, VC looks at portfolio approach expecting a few big multiples). If you’re curious, you might calculate in your LBO example what the outcome would be if the company only sold for $100M (no growth) – equity would get $50M (paying off $50M debt) from $30M initial, still a gain. But if it sold for $80M, equity gets $30M after $50M debt – basically just breaking even. This sensitivity shows the downside risk of leverage. Being able to discuss such scenarios demonstrates a grasp of how PE works. As a final step, consider Goal 4 (applying to real-world scenarios): you just applied financial concepts to how PE/VC create real investor returns – an excellent integration of knowledge that will impress in interviews or grad school discussions ([What Is Venture Capital? Definition, Pros, Cons, and How It Works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp#:~:text=Works%20www,term%20growth%20potential)) ([What Is Venture Capital?

### Week 15: **Equity Research and Analysis (Applied)**

**Topics & Objectives:** Now that you’ve built strong finance knowledge, this week focuses on the **equity research process** – essentially tying many pieces together to analyze a public company thoroughly and produce an investment recommendation. Objectives: Learn the structure of an equity research report (company overview, industry analysis, financial analysis, valuation, recommendation), practice reading a 10-K (annual report) to pick out key information, and improve your ability to articulate an investment thesis (why buy or sell this stock?). By the end, you should have experience in writing a concise **stock pitch/research report** and be ready to handle technical and fundamental questions about your chosen company (which is very useful for interviews).  
**Key Takeaways:** **Equity research** involves analyzing a company’s business model, financial performance, and valuation to determine if its stock is a good investment ([Equity Research: Job Description and Average Salary](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/120815/equity-research-job-description-average-salary.asp#:~:text=Equity%20researchers%20analyze%20stocks%20to,that%20help%20manage%20portfolio%20risk)). A research analyst will examine the company’s financial statements, talk to management (if possible), study the industry and competitors, and build a financial model to forecast earnings. The output is often a report with a **rating** (Buy/Sell/Hold) and a **target price**. Key components of a report: _investment summary_ (the thesis in a few bullet points), _business description_, _industry outlook_, _financial projections_, _valuation_ (often DCF and comparables), and _risks_ to the call. For you, the benefit of doing this end-to-end is cementing your knowledge: you’ll use accounting (Week 1-2 skills to analyze financial health), corporate finance (to consider the company’s cost of capital, investments), valuation (Week 6-8 skills to value it), and market understanding (Week 11’s macro, if relevant to this company). It’s the ultimate synthesis project.  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“How to Do Equity Research”_ – Several finance professionals have videos on steps to analyze a stock (looking at fundamentals, reading transcripts, building models). This gives a big-picture process.
- _“Anatomy of an Equity Research Report”_ – Perhaps a tutorial by a CFA or Wall Street Prep that walks through sections of a sample report and what information goes where ([Equity Research Report: Samples, Tutorials, and Explanations](https://mergersandinquisitions.com/equity-research-report/#:~:text=Explanations%20mergersandinquisitions.com%20%20Watered,%C2%B7%20Part%205%3A%20Valuation)) ([Equity Research Report - An Inside Look at What's Actually Included!](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/resources/skills/valuation/equity-research-report#:~:text=Included%21%20www,history%2C%20trends%2C%20projections%2C%20valuations)).
- _“Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) – How to Read a 10-K”_ – Guidance on parsing the annual report’s important sections to glean insights (because a lot of doing research is reading filings).  
    **Readings:**
- Wall Street Oasis: _“Guide to Equity Research Reports”_ – (if available) discussing what recruiters expect in a stock pitch or what makes a good analysis.
- Mergers & Inquisitions: _“Equity Research Report: Samples and Explanations”_ – A great resource that outlines each part of a report and even provides a sample template ([Equity Research Report: Samples, Tutorials, and Explanations](https://mergersandinquisitions.com/equity-research-report/#:~:text=Equity%20Research%20Report%3A%20Samples%2C%20Tutorials%2C,%C2%B7%20Part%205%3A%20Valuation)) ([Equity Research Report: Samples, Tutorials, and Explanations](https://mergersandinquisitions.com/equity-research-report/#:~:text=Watered,%C2%B7%20Part%205%3A%20Valuation)).
- Investopedia: _“Equity Research Analyst: Career Path”_ – to get context on what an equity researcher does daily and why the skills you’re practicing matter ([Equity Research Analyst: Career Path and Qualifications](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/120815/equity-research-career-path-and-qualifications.asp#:~:text=Qualifications%20www,reports%2C%20projections%2C%20and%20recommendations)) ([Equity Research: Job Description and Average Salary](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/120815/equity-research-job-description-average-salary.asp#:~:text=Equity%20researchers%20analyze%20stocks%20to,that%20help%20manage%20portfolio%20risk)).
- _Optional:_ Look up an actual equity research report (sometimes brokerages have older reports available, or use one provided by your MSF course if available) to see a real-world example.  
    **Assignment:** _Equity Research Report (Mini)_ – Choose a publicly traded company (preferably one you haven’t analyzed yet in-depth). Create a brief equity research report (say 3-5 pages or a set of slides) that includes: **(1) Investment Summary** – one paragraph or a few bullets with your _rating_ (Buy/Sell/Hold) and key reasons. **(2) Company Overview** – what the company does, its segments, basic financial stats (revenue, earnings, market cap, etc.). **(3) Industry Analysis** – a quick overview of the industry outlook and competitive positioning (is it a leader? what’s happening in this industry?). **(4) Financials** – trends in revenue, profit margins, and any important financial metrics (e.g., debt levels, ROE). Include at least 1-2 charts or tables (you can use the historical data or your forecasts). **(5) Valuation** – show either a DCF output (e.g., your target price from a DCF) or relative valuation (e.g., “The stock trades at 10× EV/EBITDA vs peers at 12×, implying upside if it closes the gap”). If possible, do both for practice. **(6) Recommendation/Risks** – restate your call (e.g., “I recommend BUY with a target price of $X, ~20% above current price, based on improving earnings and low valuation. Risks include XYZ.”). This is a comprehensive assignment – effectively a culmination of everything. Use Excel and Word/PPT to put it together professionally as if you’d submit to a professor or interviewer.  
    **Self-Assessment:** This is likely the most challenging but rewarding task. Compare your work to any professional or sample reports you have. Does your investment thesis make sense and stand out? Check the coherence: if you say “buy because earnings will grow,” did you back it up with evidence (like a projection or recent earnings momentum)? Ensure your valuation is not just pulled from thin air – if you did a DCF, show the assumptions; if comparables, list the peer multiples. Have someone read it and see if they find it convincing. In terms of knowledge, by doing this you likely identified gaps to research (maybe you had to look up what a term in the 10-K meant, or figure out how to treat stock-based compensation in your model, etc.). That’s good – it forces you to learn. In interview prep, the ability to discuss a stock pitch is often crucial; now you have one ready. Make sure you can answer typical questions on it: _“What drives your revenue growth assumption?”_, _“Why is this company undervalued by the market?”_, _“What could go wrong with your thesis?”_. If you can defend your analysis under such questioning, you’ve reached a level of proficiency that is on par with what incoming MSF students or interns are expected to have ([Equity Research: Job Description and Average Salary - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/120815/equity-research-job-description-average-salary.asp#:~:text=Equity%20researchers%20analyze%20stocks%20to,solving%20skills%2C%20data)) ([Equity Research vs. Investment Banking: What's the Difference?](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082615/careers-equity-research-vs-investment-banking.asp#:~:text=Equity%20researchers%20analyze%20stocks%20to,solving%20skills%2C%20data)). Congratulations – this is a significant achievement and a great confidence booster going into internships or grad school!

### Week 16: **Consulting Case Studies & Financial Decision-Making**

**Topics & Objectives:** Turn the focus to **financial consulting and business strategy**. Consulting often involves analyzing a company’s financial and operational data to advise on improving profitability or evaluating strategic decisions (like entering a new market or cutting costs). Objectives: Learn to approach a **case study** with a mix of qualitative and quantitative analysis – a common consulting scenario might be, “Our client’s profits are declining, diagnose the problem and propose a solution,” or “Should company X launch product Y given the market and financial outlook?” By the end, you should be familiar with structuring a case problem, performing back-of-the-envelope calculations (market sizing, break-even analysis), and presenting recommendations logically. This prepares you for case interviews (if consulting is a path) and also enhances your problem-solving skills using financial concepts in less structured, real-world situations.  
**Key Takeaways:** **Consulting finance cases** require both business sense and number crunching. You often start by breaking the problem into components (using frameworks like profit = revenue – cost, or market entry framework: market, competition, client capabilities, financials). For example, in a profitability case, you’d examine if revenue fell or costs rose, then dive deeper (revenue = price×volume; costs = fixed + variable, etc.) to find the root cause (maybe volume fell in one segment due to a new competitor). You then ideate solutions (increase marketing? cut prices? improve efficiency?). A key tool is **break-even analysis** – e.g., “If we invest $10M in a new project, with $5 profit per unit, we need to sell 2M units to break even.” Consultants often use simplified financial metrics (margins, ROI) to inform decisions. Communication is critical – recommendations should be backed by data but explained clearly. This week, you’ll simulate a consulting case analysis, which will utilize your finance knowledge (interpret financials, calculate impacts of decisions) and strategic thinking.  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“How to Solve a Consulting Case (Profitability)”_ – Plenty of case interview prep videos (e.g., by firms like Bain or sites like CaseInterview.com) demonstrate structured problem-solving – these will show how to lay out a hypothesis-driven analysis.
- _“Consulting Case Example – Market Entry”_ – A mock interview video where a candidate evaluates whether a company should enter a new market – note how they consider market size, investment cost, and expected returns (which ties to NPV/IRR thinking from earlier weeks).
- _“Financial Modeling for Business Decisions”_ – perhaps a shorter tutorial on calculating break-even, or evaluating a project’s profitability in a business context (kind of a mini capital budgeting but in consulting style).  
    **Readings:**
- Victor Cheng’s _Case Interview Frameworks_ (summaries available online) – focusing on Profitability and Business Situation frameworks, which map nicely to using financial data for decisions.
- McKinsey article on _“Driving Profitability”_ or HBR case study excerpt – to see real examples of analyzing business problems.
- _Optional:_ _“Case in Point” by Marc Cosentino_ – a classic book on case interviews, with sections on different case types – read the finance-related cases for how to approach them.  
    **Assignment:** _Business Case Simulation_ – **Case Prompt:** _“AutoCo”_ is an automobile manufacturer experiencing a 30% decline in profits year-over-year. They hired you to figure out why and how to fix it. **Your task:** Outline a structured approach and perform **analysis** on hypothetical data (you can make reasonable assumptions). (a) Start by breaking down the problem: profits = revenue – costs. Is revenue down, costs up, or both? Suppose you find revenue fell 10% and costs rose in raw materials. (b) Dig deeper: revenue fell because unit sales fell 5% and average price fell 5%. Why? Perhaps new competition forced price cuts and some loss of market share. Costs rose due to a spike in steel prices (raw material). (c) Quantify: If unit sales last year were 1 million cars at $20k each, this year 0.95M at $19k each, compute the revenue drop. Also, if steel cost per car rose by $500, compute the cost impact. (d) Ideate solutions: could be _increase revenue_ (e.g., invest in marketing to regain share, or develop a differentiator to avoid price cuts) and _reduce costs_ (lock in steel prices via contracts or find alternative materials, improve manufacturing efficiency). (e) Recommend: maybe a combination – e.g., “AutoCo should consider a new mid-range model to recapture market volume (expected to add X units) and negotiate long-term contracts with steel suppliers to stabilize costs. A quick win is also to cut discretionary spending to save $Y.” (f) Present some numbers: “These actions could potentially restore ~$50M to annual profit (by increasing unit sales 5% and saving $200 per car in costs, etc.).” Write this up in a consulting-style slide or memo format, focusing on a logical structure and evidence.  
    **Self-Assessment:** In consulting-style solutions, there’s often no single “correct” answer, but better answers are structured and backed by logical assumptions. Check: Did you segment the problem (revenue vs cost) and address each driver? Were your assumptions reasonable (e.g., steel price up $500 is plausible)? Did you apply finance concepts – for instance, thinking about elasticity of demand when suggesting price changes, or ROI of a marketing spend (if you included that)? If you have access to case solution guides, compare your outline. Importantly, practice explaining your reasoning as if presenting to a client or interviewer: clear and concise. Maybe role-play explaining your analysis in 5 minutes, ensuring you articulate the problem, your analysis (with a couple of key numbers), and recommendations. You’ll notice this leverages your accounting understanding (identifying cost increases), market understanding (competition effect on price), and even hedging idea (long-term contracts for steel = hedging commodity risk from Week 12). Being able to weave a narrative from problem to solution using financial evidence is a _high-level skill_ that will serve you in both consulting and many finance roles. If you can crack a profitability case like this, you are well-prepared for internship case interviews and demonstrating holistic financial thinking.

### Week 17: **Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) Fundamentals**

**Topics & Objectives:** Explore the basics of **M&A** – a key corporate finance and consulting activity. Objectives: understand the strategic reasons companies merge or acquire (synergies, diversification, growth), learn key M&A concepts like _accretion/dilution_ (how an acquisition affects EPS), _synergies_ (cost savings or revenue gains from the combination), and get a sense of how deals are analyzed financially (valuation of target, deal structure with cash/stock). By the end, you should be able to discuss why Company A might buy Company B and whether the deal makes financial sense (e.g., does the combined company create value?). We will keep it conceptual with some light calculations. This ties together prior valuation skills and adds a layer of strategy.  
**Key Takeaways:** M&A can create value when the combined company is worth more than the sum of separate companies – often due to **synergies** (e.g., eliminating duplicate costs, or cross-selling products) ([Merger: Definition, How It Works With Types and Examples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merger.asp#:~:text=Examples%20www,the%20different%20types%20of%20mergers)). However, not all M&As succeed; overpaying or poor integration can destroy value. Important terms: _Acquisition premium_ – buyers usually pay above market price for control (justified by synergies or strategic value). _Accretion/Dilution_ analysis – if a deal is done using stock, will the buyer’s EPS go up (accretion) or down (dilution) after the merger? This depends on the relative P/Es of buyer and seller. If the buyer’s stock is highly valued (low earnings yield) and it acquires a company with cheaper valuation (higher earnings yield), the deal can be accretive to EPS. Another concept: methods of payment – cash (straightforward, uses buyer’s cash or debt – interest cost vs target’s earnings trade-off) or stock (no cash outlay but existing shareholders get diluted). We’ll also note regulatory and cultural aspects but focus on finance basics.  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“Mergers and Acquisitions Explained”_ – A primer on why companies do M&A and the general process (target identification, due diligence, closing).
- _“Accretion vs Dilution in M&A”_ – A simple numerical example showing how to check if a stock deal increases or decreases EPS.
- _“Synergies in M&A”_ – Possibly a snippet explaining types of synergies (cost vs revenue) and how they impact the valuation (some bankers will quantify synergy value and incorporate into how much they can pay).  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)”_ – Definitions, types of M&A (horizontal, vertical, conglomerate) and concepts of consolidation ([Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A): Types, Structures, and Valuations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp#:~:text=,of%20debt%2C%20cash%2C%20and%20stock)) ([Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A): Types, Structures, and Valuations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp#:~:text=When%20one%20company%20takes%20over,willing%20participation%20of%20both%20companies)).
- Investopedia: _“Why Companies Merge with or Acquire Others”_ – Lists reasons like synergy, growth, eliminating competition ([What Investors Can Learn From M&A Payment Methods - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/ma-payment-reveals-alot.asp#:~:text=often%20revealed%20in%20the%20payment,method%20used%20by%20the%20company)).
- Investopedia: _“Accretion/ Dilution”_ – Short piece on how to figure if a deal is accretive or dilutive to EPS.
- _Optional:_ A short case study – e.g., summary of the Disney–Pixar acquisition (to discuss strategic rationale) or any large merger with analysis of whether it was successful.  
    **Assignment:** _M&A Analysis Exercise_ – Consider a hypothetical scenario: _TechCorp_ (Buyer) is a larger tech firm and _SoftCo_ (Target) is a smaller competitor. TechCorp’s standalone EPS is $5.00. SoftCo’s EPS is $1.00. TechCorp’s share price is $100 (thus P/E = 20×), SoftCo’s share price is $15 (P/E = 15×). TechCorp is considering acquiring SoftCo by offering a 20% premium in an all-stock deal. (a) What price per share do they offer for SoftCo? (15 * 1.2 = $18). If the deal is all-stock, TechCorp will issue new shares to SoftCo’s shareholders at $100 each to pay $18 for each SoftCo share. So exchange ratio: each SoftCo share gets 0.18 of a TechCorp share (since $18/$100). (b) Calculate the combined company’s EPS after the merger, ignoring synergies. TechCorp’s earnings were (5 * its # of shares), SoftCo’s were (1 * SoftCo’s # of shares). Assume TechCorp had 100M shares (earnings $500M) and SoftCo 20M shares (earnings $20M). Combined earnings = $520M. TechCorp will issue 20M*0.18 = 3.6M new shares to buy SoftCo. So new share count = 103.6M. Combined EPS = $520M / 103.6M ≈ $5.02. (c) Is the deal accretive or dilutive to TechCorp’s $5.00 EPS? It’s slightly accretive (goes to $5.02, a +0.4%). This is because SoftCo’s P/E was lower (earnings yield higher) than TechCorp’s, so issuing high P/E stock to buy lower P/E earnings gave a boost. (d) Identify at least two potential synergies or strategic benefits: e.g., elimination of duplicate R&D, cross-sell SoftCo’s product to TechCorp’s clients, or simply greater scale to negotiate with suppliers. (e) Identify two risks: e.g., integration challenges (merging cultures, systems), or risk of not realizing projected synergies, and perhaps TechCorp’s share price could fall if investors think they overpaid. Summarize whether you think the deal makes sense financially and strategically (in our numbers, yes financially accretive and maybe strategic if they compete in same space – but if no synergies, the premium paid needs justification).  
    **Self-Assessment:** Verify the arithmetic: combined EPS being accretive makes sense given the P/E disparity (if reversed, a high P/E acquirer buying an even higher P/E target with stock would dilute EPS). This simple model ignores synergy – if you assume synergies (say $10M additional earnings), you can recalc combined EPS to see more accretion. Reflect on the **strategic rationale**: can you articulate why a premium is paid? (The target’s shareholders need incentive to sell; ideally the buyer believes the combined value exceeds price paid, covering that premium ([What Investors Can Learn From M&A Payment Methods - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/ma-payment-reveals-alot.asp#:~:text=Investopedia%20www,method%20used%20by%20the%20company))). This week likely introduced new terms, so ensure clarity: _What are synergies?_ (when 2+2=5 in a merger, often cost savings ([Vertical Merger: Definition, How It Works, Purpose, and Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalmerger.asp#:~:text=Vertical%20Merger%3A%20Definition%2C%20How%20It,than%20the%20two%20individual%20companies))). _What’s a merger vs an acquisition?_ (merger often of equals, acquisition one firm absorbing another ([Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A): Types, Structures, and Valuations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp#:~:text=When%20one%20company%20takes%20over,willing%20participation%20of%20both%20companies))). _Why might a stock-for-stock deal be chosen over cash?_ (Maybe the buyer’s stock is highly valued (good currency) or they want to preserve cash / keep debt low; also spreads risk with target’s shareholders). If possible, discuss a real recent M&A deal in news as an example. You’ve now touched on essentially all major areas of finance: M&A brings together strategy, valuation, and financial analysis, which you’ve been cultivating. This prepares you for technical interview questions like “Walk me through a merger model” or conceptual ones like “How do you know if an acquisition will be accretive?” You might not be an expert, but you can outline the basics, which is the expectation at the internship applicant level ([Merger: Definition, How It Works With Types and Examples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merger.asp#:~:text=Examples%20www,the%20different%20types%20of%20mergers)).

### Week 18: **Portfolio Management and Asset Allocation**

**Topics & Objectives:** Revisit portfolio theory in a more applied way – how does one construct an investment portfolio? Objectives: Understand the concept of asset allocation (stocks vs bonds vs alternatives), the role of diversification across asset classes (not just within a stock portfolio as in Week 9), and basics of portfolio rebalancing and performance evaluation. Also cover risk-adjusted return metrics like **Sharpe ratio** (return per unit of risk). By the end, you should grasp how an institutional investor or wealth manager approaches building a balanced portfolio and be able to reason about what a suitable portfolio might look like for different goals (e.g., young investor vs retiree). This complements the earlier risk/return theory with practical application and prepares you for any discussion on investments or CFA Level I type material.  
**Key Takeaways:** **Asset allocation** is often cited as the most important determinant of portfolio returns (more than stock picking). A balanced portfolio might include equities for growth, fixed income for stability/income, and perhaps alternatives (real estate, commodities, etc.) for diversification. The **efficient frontier** (from Modern Portfolio Theory) concept says for a given level of risk, there’s an optimal mix that yields the highest return ([5 Tips for Diversifying Your Portfolio - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/072303.asp#:~:text=5%20Tips%20for%20Diversifying%20Your,Diversified%3F%20By)). Practically, many use a 60/40 stock/bond mix as a baseline for moderate risk. Younger investors can take more risk (more equities), while those nearing retirement shift to bonds/cash. Rebalancing is done periodically to maintain target weights (selling some of what went up, buying what went down – buy low, sell high inherently). **Sharpe ratio** = (Portfolio return – risk-free rate) / std deviation of portfolio; it’s a measure of risk-adjusted performance – higher Sharpe is better (means either higher returns for same risk or same return with lower volatility). Also, **Alpha** is performance above what CAPM would predict – active managers aim for alpha. For you, understanding these helps in interviews (asset management or general finance roles) and sets groundwork if you pursue CFA or further studies.  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“Asset Allocation Explained”_ – by an investment professional or professor – covering why diversify across asset classes and typical allocations (maybe referencing Ray Dalio’s All-Weather portfolio or similar).
- _“Modern Portfolio Theory and Efficient Frontier”_ – a visual explanation of risk/return trade-off and how combining assets can optimize a portfolio.
- _“Sharpe Ratio and Alpha”_ – e.g., Khan Academy or other explaining what Sharpe ratio is and how to interpret it; similarly alpha (maybe in context of mutual fund performance).  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Portfolio Management Basics”_ – an overview of strategic vs tactical asset allocation, and factors like investor risk tolerance and time horizon.
- Investopedia: _“Sharpe Ratio”_ – definition and example ([5 Tips for Diversifying Your Portfolio - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/072303.asp#:~:text=5%20Tips%20for%20Diversifying%20Your,Diversified%3F%20By)) ([5 Tips for Diversifying Your Portfolio - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/072303.asp#:~:text=sacrificing%20its%20expected%20return,Diversified%3F%20By)).
- Investopedia: _“Alpha (Finance)”_ – definition of alpha as excess return over benchmark.
- _Optional:_ If interested in personal finance angle – a brief read on target-date retirement funds (which automatically shift allocation over time) to see application of these principles.  
    **Assignment:** _Design a Model Portfolio_ – Imagine you are advising two clients: Alice (age 30, long time horizon, comfortable with risk) and Bob (age 60, nearing retirement, conservative). Outline an appropriate asset allocation for each. For example: **Alice** – 80% equities (with maybe 60% in a global stock index fund, 20% in emerging markets or small caps), 15% bonds, 5% alternatives (perhaps REITs or commodities). **Bob** – 40% equities (focused on blue-chip dividend stocks), 50% bonds (with tilt to high-quality corporates/municipals for income), 10% cash or short-term fixed income for stability/liquidity. Explain your rationale: Alice can weather volatility and seek growth; Bob needs capital preservation and income. (b) For Alice’s portfolio, assume expected return ~8% with volatility ~15%; for Bob, expected return ~5% with volatility ~8%. Calculate an approximate Sharpe ratio for each assuming risk-free rate ~2%: Alice Sharpe ≈ (8-2)/15 = 0.40, Bob Sharpe ≈ (5-2)/8 = 0.375. So Alice’s higher risk is compensated by higher return, yielding a slightly better risk-adjusted return (this is just hypothetical). (c) Discuss rebalancing: If next year equities soar and Alice’s equity portion becomes 85%, what would you do? (Answer: likely sell some equity to bring back to 80% target, buying more in lagging assets, to maintain risk profile). (d) Mention diversification benefits: Even Bob’s 40% in stocks still helps his long-term growth and beats inflation, while his bonds protect in years when stocks crash (in 2008, bonds did much better than stocks, cushioning the blow in a balanced portfolio). Keep the answer in a client-friendly tone (this is partly a test of explaining complex ideas simply).  
    **Self-Assessment:** Evaluate whether your allocations match conventional wisdom (they should – younger = more stocks, older = more bonds). If you gave Alice 100% stocks, you might note it’s high risk – even though time is on her side, some bond cushion can reduce volatility significantly without huge sacrifice in long-term returns. Check your Sharpe calculations – do they make sense dimensionally (higher return and lower vol = higher Sharpe)? Consider: _Can you explain to someone why diversification works using correlation concept?_ (e.g., when stocks zig, bonds often zag or at least don’t fall as much – smoothing the ride). _What is the risk-free rate nowadays and why use it in Sharpe?_ (Often use short-term Treasury yield as risk-free). _What does a negative alpha mean?_ (the investment underperformed the market on a risk-adjusted basis, meaning the manager didn’t add value). This week is less about new calculations and more about synthesis and explanation. If you can articulate a coherent investment strategy for different needs, you’re demonstrating both technical understanding and communication – key for many roles. Also, reflect on your own potential portfolio given you’ve learned so much – perhaps that’s an added personal benefit of this course!

### Week 19: **Foreign Exchange (FX) and International Finance**

**Topics & Objectives:** Address the global side of finance – **currency markets** and basics of international finance. Objectives: Understand how exchange rates work (what it means for a currency to appreciate or depreciate), factors that influence exchange rates (interest rates, inflation, political stability), and the impact of currency movements on companies (e.g., export competitiveness, foreign earnings). We’ll also introduce the concept of interest rate parity briefly (the idea that interest rate differentials between countries are offset by forward exchange rate differences). By the end, you should be able to interpret a headline like “USD/JPY falls to 110” (meaning the dollar weakened vs yen, now 1 USD = 110 yen), and explain how a strong vs weak domestic currency can affect an economy or an investor’s portfolio. This is useful for global macro awareness (hedge funds, IB, etc.) and if you encounter firms with international operations in equity research or consulting.  
**Key Takeaways:** The **Forex market** is the largest and most liquid market globally ([The Greatest Currency Trades Ever Made - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/greatest-currency-trades.asp#:~:text=The%20Greatest%20Currency%20Trades%20Ever,services%20are%20traded%20between%20nations)). Currency values are relative (a currency strengthens against one means it weakens against the other). Key drivers: _Interest rates_ (higher rates often attract foreign capital, raising currency value), _Inflation_ (higher inflation tends to weaken a currency in the long run as purchasing power erodes), _Trade balances_ (countries with trade surpluses might see their currency strengthen due to demand for their goods/currency), and _Market sentiment/risk aversion_ (in crises, investors often flock to safe-haven currencies like USD or CHF). For businesses: a strong home currency makes exports more expensive abroad (bad for exporters) but makes imports cheaper (good for importers and consumers). A weak home currency helps exporters but can raise import prices (possibly fueling inflation). You should also be aware of tools like **forward contracts** companies use to hedge FX risk (we touched in Week 12’s hedging). As an investor, currency movements affect international investment returns (e.g., a US investor in European stocks must consider EUR/USD changes).  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“Intro to Foreign Exchange”_ – likely Khan Academy or a similar educational source that covers what FX is and how to read exchange rates.
- _“What Causes Exchange Rates to Change?”_ – a concise video listing factors like interest rates, inflation, etc., perhaps by an economist or Investopedia video.
- _“The Impact of Strong vs Weak Dollar”_ – a news segment or explainer that discusses who benefits and loses from a strong USD, which ties the concepts to real world (exporters, travelers, commodity prices since oil is priced in USD, etc.).  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Foreign Exchange Market”_ – definition and scale of the FX market ([Forex Market: Who Trades Currencies and Why - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/who-trades-forex-and-why.asp#:~:text=The%20foreign%20exchange%2C%20also%20known,1%20Forex%20is%20the)) ([Forex (FX): Definition, How to Trade Currencies, and Examples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp#:~:text=Examples%20www,trillions%20of%20dollars%20changing)).
- Investopedia: _“What Determines Exchange Rates?”_ – outlines factors affecting currency values (interest rates, economic indicators, etc.).
- Investopedia: _“Carry Trade”_ (optional but interesting) – strategy that involves borrowing in a low-interest currency to invest in a high-interest currency – relies on stable exchange rates.
- _Optional:_ Look at a recent currency chart (like EUR/USD over the past year) and maybe read an article on why it moved (e.g., “Fed raising rates boosted USD in 2022”).  
    **Assignment:** _FX Scenario Analysis_ – (a) Suppose 1 USD = 0.90 EUR today. If the USD “strengthens” 10% against the euro, what is the new rate? (Strengthening means 1 USD gets more euros, so 0.90 *1.1 = 0.99 EUR per USD.) Conversely, from the euro perspective, the euro weakened – previously 1 EUR = 1/0.90 = $1.11, now 1 EUR ≈ $1.01. (b) If a US company earns €50 million from European operations, what is that in USD before and after the move? Before: €50M * $1.11 = $55.5M. After USD strengthen (1 EUR = $1.01): €50M * $1.01 = $50.5M. So the stronger USD cut the USD-reported earnings by ~$5M. Explain: The US company’s euro earnings are worth fewer dollars now. (c) Consider a European tourist coming to the US with a budget of €5,000. Before, €5,000 = $5,550 to spend. After USD strengthened (euro weakened), €5,000 = $5,050. The European tourist can buy fewer dollars, making the US trip more expensive. (d) Now qualitative: Company XYZ in Japan exports cars priced in yen. If the yen depreciates sharply against other currencies, how does it affect XYZ? (Likely positive – Japanese cars become cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting export sales and profits in yen terms). Conversely, if yen appreciates strongly, XYZ might struggle as their cars become pricier abroad, possibly losing market share or seeing profit margins shrink. (e) Many global investors hedge currency risk. Explain one method: e.g., a US investor owning European stocks could enter a forward contract to sell euros for dollars at today’s rate for future, locking exchange rate (so even if euro falls, they get a fixed USD amount). Write a short paragraph summarizing why understanding FX is important for multinational companies and international investors (essentially touching on what you computed: it can significantly alter financial outcomes, separate from core business performance).  
    **Self-Assessment:** Check calculations – currency arithmetic can confuse at first (remember if USD strengthens vs EUR, the USD/EUR quote goes up in our definition because it’s EUR per USD; but the EUR/USD often quoted inversely would go down in value). Always clarify which currency is base. Ensure you can articulate: _“Who benefits from a strong dollar?”_ (US importers, US consumers buying foreign goods or traveling abroad, foreign exporters to US). _“Who benefits from a weak dollar?”_ (US exporters, US tourism industry from foreign visitors, possibly US companies with big overseas earnings as we saw ([The Greatest Currency Trades Ever Made - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/greatest-currency-trades.asp#:~:text=The%20Greatest%20Currency%20Trades%20Ever,services%20are%20traded%20between%20nations))). And _“How can companies manage FX risk?”_ (hedging via forwards/options – as you discussed in part e, and also by naturally matching costs and revenues in same currency if possible). You might test yourself: If inflation in the UK is much higher than in the US, what might you expect GBP/USD to do in long run? (Likely GBP to weaken against USD because its purchasing power is eroding faster). These are the kind of integrated macro-finance insights valuable in roles or further studies. Plus, now news about currency fluctuations or the term “Dollar Index” should be more meaningful to you.

### Week 20: **Behavioral Finance and Market Psychology**

**Topics & Objectives:** A brief foray into **behavioral finance**, tying up our course with a look at how real investor behavior deviates from the theoretical rational models. Objectives: Learn about common **cognitive biases** that affect financial decisions (e.g., overconfidence, confirmation bias, loss aversion ([Behavioral Finance: Biases, Emotions and Financial Behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp#:~:text=,all%20equities%20are%20priced%20fairly)), herd behavior ([Behavioral Finance: Biases, Emotions and Financial Behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp#:~:text=,as%20anxiety%2C%20anger%2C%20fear%2C%20or))) and recognize examples in market phenomena (bubbles and crashes often have behavioral elements). Understand that psychology can lead to mispricing – which value investors or hedge funds might exploit – but can also make it hard to stick to strategies (e.g., panic selling in a downturn is a behavioral pitfall). By the end, you should be able to identify a few biases in yourself or others and have strategies to mitigate them (like having an investment plan to avoid emotional trading). This is a softer topic but important for a well-rounded finance education and often tested in CFA ethics/behavioral sections.  
**Key Takeaways:** Humans are not always rational profit-maximizers. **Behavioral finance** studies the influence of psychology on investor behavior ([Behavioral Finance: Biases, Emotions and Financial Behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp#:~:text=Behavioral%20finance%20is%20an%20economic,to%20psychological%20factors%20or%20biases)). Key biases: _Overconfidence_ (overestimating one’s knowledge – e.g., trading too much thinking you can outsmart the market, often reducing returns), _Confirmation bias_ (seeking information that confirms pre-existing beliefs, ignoring contrary data ([Understanding Common Types of Bias in Investing - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bias.asp#:~:text=Understanding%20Common%20Types%20of%20Bias,based%20on%20facts%20and%20evidence))), _Loss aversion_ (feeling the pain of losses more than the pleasure of gains – leading investors to hold losing stocks too long to avoid realizing a loss ([Behavioral Finance: Biases, Emotions and Financial Behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp#:~:text=the%C2%A0stock%20market%20%C2%A0as%20the%20cause,to%20a%20tendency%20to%20make)) or sell winners too early). _Herd behavior_ (following the crowd – contributes to bubbles: everyone buys because others are buying ([Behavioral Finance: Biases, Emotions and Financial Behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp#:~:text=,as%20anxiety%2C%20anger%2C%20fear%2C%20or))). Recognizing these can explain anomalies like momentum (stocks keep going up beyond fundamental value because of herd), or why markets might not always be efficient (if biases cause systematic errors). Strategies like **value investing** often bank on contrarian thinking – going against herd, which requires overcoming emotional biases. As a future MSF student or intern, being aware of these biases can make you a more disciplined analyst (e.g., double-checking facts that go against your thesis, or not falling in love with a stock).  
**Lectures (YouTube):**

- _“Introduction to Behavioral Finance”_ – possibly a lecture excerpt summarizing the field and key findings (Daniel Kahneman’s work, etc.).
- _“Common Investor Biases”_ – an animation or talk highlighting biases like loss aversion, anchoring (relying too much on initial reference like purchase price when deciding to sell), etc., with simple examples.
- _“Market Bubbles and Psychology”_ – e.g., a TED talk or similar on how emotions drive booms and busts (for instance, discussing the Dot-com bubble or Bitcoin’s roller coaster).  
    **Readings:**
- Investopedia: _“Behavioral Finance”_ – definition and some key concepts ([Behavioral Finance: Biases, Emotions and Financial Behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp#:~:text=Behavioral%20finance%20is%20an%20economic,to%20psychological%20factors%20or%20biases)) ([Behavioral Finance: Biases, Emotions and Financial Behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp#:~:text=,all%20equities%20are%20priced%20fairly)).
- Forbes or WSJ article on a specific bias (like “Why Investors Are Their Own Worst Enemies” discussing overtrading and performance).
- _Optional:_ Excerpts from _“Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman_ – not finance-specific, but foundational on cognitive biases that certainly apply to investing.  
    **Assignment:** _Bias Identification_ – Reflect on a hypothetical (or real) investment decision and identify which biases might come into play. For example: An investor bought Stock A at $50; it’s now $35. He refuses to sell until it “gets back to $50” because selling would lock in a loss. **Bias**: _Loss aversion_ and _Anchoring_ (anchoring to the $50 purchase price). Another investor keeps buying more of a hot tech stock because all his friends brag about it – **Bias**: _Herd mentality_, possibly _FOMO (fear of missing out)_. (a) List 3 biases and provide a one-sentence scenario for each (like above). (b) For each scenario, suggest a corrective action or rational strategy: e.g., for loss aversion – “I should evaluate the stock on its current merits and future prospects, not the past price; if I wouldn’t buy it now, maybe I should sell and reallocate – consider tax loss benefits too.” For herd behavior – “Do independent analysis; just because others are euphoric doesn’t mean the investment is sound. Consider valuation and fundamentals to avoid chasing fads.” (c) Considering your own approach to this course: did you notice any bias in how you approached learning or assignments? (For fun introspection – e.g., confirmation bias: maybe you interpreted ambiguous data in assignments in a way that fit what you already believed or wanted to see). (d) Write a short paragraph on how understanding behavioral finance could make you a better investor or finance professional. (For example, being aware of overconfidence might make you double-check your model assumptions; knowledge of herd behavior might encourage you to be skeptical of “everyone says this stock is a sure thing”).  
    **Self-Assessment:** The scenarios you created – do they clearly illustrate the bias? (Loss aversion: reluctance to sell at a loss – classic ([Behavioral Finance: Biases, Emotions and Financial Behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp#:~:text=the%C2%A0stock%20market%20%C2%A0as%20the%20cause,to%20a%20tendency%20to%20make)). Overconfidence: maybe someone trading frequently without sufficient research because they trust their gut too much. Confirmation bias: an analyst who only reads bullish reports on a stock they like and ignores bearish signals ([Understanding Common Types of Bias in Investing - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bias.asp#:~:text=Bias%20is%20an%20irrational%20assumption,based%20on%20facts%20and%20evidence)).) There’s no numeric answer, but check your advice: it should align with rational best practices (diversification, disciplined rebalancing, focus on data over emotion, etc.). If you said something like “to counter herd behavior, always do the opposite of the crowd,” that might be an overcorrection – sometimes the crowd is right. Better: “Be aware of crowd influence; make decisions based on analysis, not emotion.” If you have access to any quiz or checklist of biases (there are online quizzes where you can see which biases you fall prey to), that might be a fun way to test yourself. Ultimately, this week is about mindset: as you enter the finance field, maintaining a rational, bias-aware approach will set you apart. As a wrap-up to the course, think of how this ties to everything: we learned models and methods assuming rational actors (NPV, CAPM, etc.), but behavioral finance reminds us markets and decisions have an extra layer of complexity ([Behavioral Finance: Biases, Emotions and Financial Behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioralfinance.asp#:~:text=Behavioral%20finance%20is%20an%20economic,to%20psychological%20factors%20or%20biases)). Acknowledge that in discussions, and you’ll show a mature understanding of finance.

**Next Steps:** Congratulations on completing this intensive 24-week self-paced course! You’ve built a foundation across accounting, corporate finance, valuation, investments, economics, and more – essentially an expedited MSF primer. To consolidate your knowledge and prepare for real-world applications and interviews: **keep practicing**. Continue reading financial news (apply your macro and micro understanding when reading WSJ/FT/Bloomberg articles), maybe manage a small mock portfolio to apply portfolio theories, and revisit tough concepts periodically (the cited resources throughout can be reference points ([Financial Ratio Analysis: Definition, Types, Examples, and How to Use](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratioanalysis.asp#:~:text=%2A%20Ratio%20analysis%20compares%20line,ratio%2C%20and%20inventory%20turnover%20ratio)) ([CAPM Model: Advantages and Disadvantages](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021015/advantages-and-disadvantages-capm-model.asp#:~:text=The%20capital%20asset%20pricing%20model,free%20rate))). For internship prep, leverage Weeks 21-24: practice explaining things out loud (e.g., pretend the interviewer asks “Walk me through a DCF” or “Why do you want to work in hedge funds?” – you can now answer with confidence citing what you learned). Utilize the self-assessment quizzes and any available CFA or online practice questions to test retention. And if pursuing an MSF, you’re in great shape to hit the ground running – many of these topics will appear in your graduate coursework, so having seen them gives you a huge advantage. Remember, learning finance is like building a toolkit – this course gave you the tools, and with continued use, you’ll become ever more adept in using them to carve out solutions in the finance world. Good luck on your journey ahead!
